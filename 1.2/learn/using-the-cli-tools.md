## Using the Ballerina Tool

In the CLI, execute the `ballerina help` command to view all the actions you can perform with it as shown below.

```sh
→ ballerina help 
NAME
       The Ballerina build tool

SYNOPSIS
       ballerina <-v | --version>
       ballerina [command] <-h | --help>
       ballerina <command> [<args>]


DESCRIPTION
       Ballerina is a statically typed, concurrent programming language, focusing on network interaction and structured data. It is intended to be the core of a language-centric middleware platform. It has all the general-purpose
       functionality expected of a modern programming language, but it also has several unusual aspects that make it
       particularly suitable for its intended purpose.

       Find more information at: https://ballerina.io/


OPTIONS
       -v, --version
           Print the Ballerina version information.

       -h, --help
           Print usage details of a command.

Use 'ballerina help <command>' for more information on a specific command.
```

 You can use the `ballerina` command in the below format.

> `ballerina <THE-COMMAND> <ITS-ARGUEMENTS>`

> **Tip:** You can view details of any of the commands below by executing `ballerina help <COMMAND>`. For example, the below is the output of the `ballerina help pull` command.

```sh
→ ballerina help pull
NAME
       ballerina-pull - Fetch modules from Ballerina Central

SYNOPSIS
       ballerina pull <org-name>/<module-name>[:<version>]


DESCRIPTION
       Pull downloads the specified module from Ballerina Central
       along with its dependencies. It then caches this module at
       '.ballerina' directory in user home.

       Ballerina Central is a module repository hosted at
       https://central.ballerina.io/. A module repository organizes modules
       into a three-level hierarchy: organization, module name, and version.
       Organizations are unique within a repository and can be mapped to an
       individual user or organization registered with the repository.


EXAMPLES
       Pull the latest version of 'gmail' connector in 'wso2' organization
       from Ballerina Central.
          $ ballerina pull wso2/gmail

       Pull the '1.1.0' version of 'gmail' connector in 'wso2' organization
       from Ballerina Central.
          $ ballerina pull wso2/gmail:1.1.0
```
