Install the [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) version `1.60.0` or later.\n\n2. Download and install [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/downloads/).\n \n3. Install the [Ballerina VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.ballerina). \n\n4. Open a [single Ballerina package](#open-a-single-ballerina-package) or [multiple Ballerina packages](#open-multiple-ballerina-packages) to activate the extension.\n\n## Open Ballerina packages\n\nYou can either work on a single [Ballerina package](https://ballerina.io/learn/package-references/) at a time or use [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) of VS Code to work on several related Ballerina packages at the same time. \n\n>**Info:** When the extension is activated properly, you can see the `Ballerina SDK: <version>` in the status bar at the bottom left corner.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/get-started/show-version-on-vscode.png\" class=\"cInlineImage-half\"/>\n\n### Open a single Ballerina package\n\nUse one of the following options to open a Ballerina package:\n\n1. From the command line, navigate to the directory path of the package, and execute the `code .` command.\n\n2. From the top menu of the VS Code editor, click **File > Open Folder...**, and select the package.\n\n### Open multiple Ballerina packages\n\nTo open multiple Ballerina packages as a VS Code workspace, add all the related Ballerina packages to the workspace using one of the following methods. \n\n>**Info:** If you already have one Ballerina package opened in the VS Code editor, you can add other related packages to the same workspace. For instructions, see [adding folders to multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_adding-folders).\n\n1. Add each Ballerina package to the workspace using the **Add folder to workspace** option in the top menu of the VS Code editor.\n\n2.
