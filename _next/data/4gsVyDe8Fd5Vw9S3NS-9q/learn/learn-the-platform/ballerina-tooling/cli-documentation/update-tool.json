Ballerina has a stable and production-ready official compiler called jBallerina, which targets the JVM.\n\nAlso, there is a plan to develop a native compiler called nBallerina in the future, which will target platforms such as Linux, Windows, and macOS.\n\nBallerina distribution is a term, which refers to these jBallerina and nBallerina compilers.\n\n### Get to know the release channels\n\nBallerina distributions are released via two different release channels at the moment. Swan Lake release channel is the primary release channel and the other one is the 1.x release channel. It is recommended to use Swan Lake release channel, if you are new to Ballerina.\n\nBallerina does not have a release channel yet for nightly builds that give you access to the latest perhaps unstable features.\n\n#### Patch releases\n\nPatch releases of Ballerina distributions contain bug fixes and fixes for critical stability and security related issues. Occasionally, you would see on-demand patch releases for 2201.0.x.\n\n*Example patch releases: 2201.0.1, 2201.1.1*\n\n## Use the update tool\n\nIf you haven’t installed Ballerina yet, see [Install Ballerina](/learn/install-ballerina/) for the instructions.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you would see the following directory structure inside the installation directory.\n\n```sh\n.\n├── bin\n│   └── bal\n├── dependencies\n│   └── jdk-11.0.8+10-jre\n├── distributions\n│   ├── ballerina-slalpha3\n│   ├── ballerina-slalpha4\n│   ├── jballerina-1.1.0\n│   ├── jballerina-1.2.8\n│   └── ballerina-version\n└── lib\n    └── ballerina-command-1.3.1.jar\n```\n\nThe `distributions` is the directory, in which all your installed distributions are maintained. Only one distribution from the above list can be active at a given time. \n\n> **Note:** The Ballerina Tool delegates most of the user requests to the active distribution. The commands such as `build`, `test`, `run`, `pull`, and `push` are delegated to the active distribution, while the commands such as `dist` and `version` are handled by the tool itself.\n  \n  E.g., when you invoke `bal build`, the Ballerina Tool dispatches this request to the active distribution.\n\nYou can [change this active distribution](#change-the-active-distribution) at any time or manage it using the Ballerina Tool. However, first, you need to update the Ballerina Tool to its latest version.\n\n### Update the Ballerina tool\n\nThe `bal update` command updates the Ballerina Tool itself to the latest version. Ballerina Tool versions are independent of the Ballerina distribution versions. These tool updates are expected to be rare compared to distribution releases.\n\n```sh\n→ bal update\nFetching the latest tool version from the remote server...\nDownloading ballerina-command-1.3.3 100% [=====================================================================================================================================================================] 1/1 MB (0:00:01 / 0:00:00) \nUpdating environment variables\nThe ‘ballerina’ command was changed to ‘bal’. Please use ‘bal’ command from now onwards.\nIe : $ bal build\n     $ bal dist list\n     $ bal dist update\nTool version updated to the latest version: 1.3.3\nCleaning old files...\nUpdate successfully completed\n\nIf you want to update the Ballerina distribution, use 'bal dist update'\n```\n\n## Manage your Ballerina distributions\n\nAfter updating the Ballerina Tool, you can use the `bal dist` command to manage Ballerina distributions. The `bal help dist` output below shows all the details about the `bal dist` command.\n\n```sh\n→ bal help dist\nNAME\n       bal-dist - Manage Ballerina distributions\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       bal dist <command> <-h | --help>\n       bal dist <command> [<args>]\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Dist enables you to install, update, and switch among Ballerina distributions\n       from patch and minor release channels.\n\n\nOPTIONS\n       -h, --help\n           Print usage details of a command.\n\n\nBALLERINA COMMANDS\n       Here is a list of available subcommands:\n\n       update     Update to the latest patch version of the active distribution\n       pull       Fetch a distribution and set it as the active version\n       use        Set a distribution as the active distribution\n       list       List locally and remotely available distributions\n       remove     Remove distributions in your local environment\n\n\nUse 'bal help dist <command>' for more information on a specific command.\n```\n\nMost of these subcommands are self-explanatory. Therefore, the sections below introduce them briefly.\n\n### List all local and remote distributions\n\nThe `bal dist list` command lists the installed distributions in your local environment. It also lists the distributions available for you to download.\n\n```sh\n→ bal dist list\nDistributions available locally: \n\n  slalpha4 \n  slalpha5 \n  slbeta3\n  slbeta6\n* 2201.0.0  \n\nDistributions available remotely:\n\n1.* channel\n\n...To list all the previous distributions execute 'bal dist list -a'\n  1.2.10\n  1.2.11\n  1.2.12\n  1.2.13\n  1.2.14\n  1.2.15\n  1.2.17\n  1.2.16\n  1.2.20\n  1.2.23 - latest\n\nSwan Lake channel\n\n* 2201.0.0 - latest\n\nUse 'bal help dist' for more information on specific commands.\n```\n\n> **Note:** The star (*) indicates the active distribution.\n\n### Remove a distribution\n\nThe `bal dist remove <distribution>` command allows you to delete a particular distribution from your local environment. If you have been updating Ballerina regularly, you may have accumulated many unused distribution versions. This command helps you to clean them up.\n\n```sh\n→ bal dist remove slalpha5\nDistribution 'slalpha5' successfully removed\n```\n\n### Update to the latest preview/patch version\n\nThe `bal dist update` command updates your active distribution to the latest patch version.\n\n```sh\n→ sudo bal dist update\nFetching the latest patch distribution for 'ballerina-slalpha4' from the remote server...\nFetching the 'slalpha5' distribution from the remote server...\nDownloading slalpha5 100% [================================================================================================================================================================================] 319/319 MB (0:01:21 / 0:00:00) \n\nFetching the dependencies for 'slalpha5' from the remote server...\nDependency 'jdk-11.0.8+10-jre' is already available locally\nSuccessfully set the latest patch distribution 'slalpha5' as the active distribution\n```\n\n>**Note:** If the active distribution in your environment is `slp4`, it will bump to the next Swan Lake Preview version, which is `slp5`, and will update to it.\n\n### Pull a specific distribution\n\nThe `bal dist pull <distribution>` command downloads a particular distribution and stores it in your local environment. It also sets the fetched distribution as the active distribution.\n\n```sh\n→ bal dist pull slalpha4\nFetching the 'slalpha4' distribution from the remote server...\nDownloading slalpha4 100% [================================================================================================================================================================================] 287/287 MB (0:01:26 / 0:00:00) \n  \nFetching the dependencies for 'slalpha4' from the remote server...\nDependency 'jdk-11.0.8+10-jre' is already available locally\n'slalpha4' successfully set as the active distribution\n```\n\n### Change the active distribution\n\nThe `bal dist use <distribution>` command sets a particular distribution version as the active one.\n\n```sh\n→ bal dist use slalpha3\n'slalpha3' successfully set as the active distribution\n```\n","id":"update-tool","sub":"ballerina-tooling","third":"cli-documentation","slug":"ballerina-tooling/cli-documentation/update-tool"},"__N_SSG":true}
