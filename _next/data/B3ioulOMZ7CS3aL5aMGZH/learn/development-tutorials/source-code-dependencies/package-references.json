It contains all the meta information that is needed to build your package.\n\nBelow is an example of a simple `Ballerina.toml` file.\n\n```toml\n[package]\norg = \"samjs\"\nname = \"winery\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\n\n[build-options]\nobservabilityIncluded = true\n```\n\n### The `org` field\n\nThe organization is a logical name used for grouping modules together under a common namespace within a repository. \n\nOrganization name is mandatory and can only contain alphanumerics, underscore, and the maximum length is 256 characters.\n\nWhen you run the `bal new` command, the organization name by default will be set to the user name of your machine. You can choose to update the `Ballerina.toml` file to amend the organization name appropriately.\n\nAs described in [Define the organization](/learn/publish-packages-to-ballerina-central/#define-the-organization), the restrictions for the organization name of a package when publishing to <a href=\"https://central.ballerina.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Ballerina Central</a> should also be considered before choosing an organization name.\n\n\n### The `name` field\n\nThe package name is an identifier used to refer to the package.\n\nThe name can only contain alphanumerics, underscore, period, and the maximum length is 256 characters.\n\nIf the package name is not provided in the `Ballerina.toml` file, then the current directory name is set as the package name. If there are any characters in the directory name mismatching the allowed regex, these will be replaced with the `_` character.\n\n#### Hierarchical package names\n\nWhen a package provides multiple functionalities, it is better to split it into multiple packages instead.  For scenarios like this, you can give a hierarchical name to the package.\n\nFor example, if you need to provide a set of APIs to communicate with AWS, you can choose to support APIs to AWS services using multiple packages such as `aws.s3`, `aws.sqs`, `aws.rds`, etc.\n\n#### The split module condition\n\nA `split module condition` occurs when the latest versions of two different packages contain the same module, resulting in a build failure. When using hierarchical package names, ensure that the package repository does not hold another package containing a module with the same name in its latest version.\n\nFor example, if you created and published to Ballerina Central, the `1.0.0` version of `aws.rds` package containing `aws.rds.mysql` module\nand decide to move the `aws.rds.mysql` module to a separate package later, you need to follow the below steps.\n\n1. Push a new version(`1.0.1`) of the `aws.rds` package that does not contain the `aws.rds.mysql` module\n2. Push new `aws.rds.mysql` package\n\n### The `version` field\n\nBallerina strictly follows the rules of <a href=\"https://semver.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Semantic Versioning</a>. Therefore, in general, you should follow the SemVer best practices when versioning a package.\n\n*   If the package is in the initial stages of development, label the package with the zero major version (`0.x.y`). This will give the user a hint that API changes are frequent and that the package is far from being production-ready.\n\n*   Use versions as three numeric parts `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (E.g., `1.0.0`).\n    *   Increment the patch version when only backward compatible bug fixes are introduced.\n    *   Increment the minor version when new backward compatible functionality is introduced to the public API.\n    *   Increment the major version when any backward incompatible changes are introduced to the public API.\n\n*   When you are stabilizing the package to roll out to production, pre-release versions are suitable for versioning (E.g. `1.0.0-alpha`).\n    Pre-release versions are not considered production-ready. Even though not frequent compared to the initial development phase, API changes are possible.\n\n*   If the changes to pre-release versions are incremental, you can use the numeric pre-release versioning technique (E.g. `1.0.0-alpha.1`, `1.0.0-alpha.2`).\n\n*   Once the package is production-ready, you can use a stable version (E.g. `1.0.0`). Any subsequent minor or patch releases of the same major version should be backward compatible and, should not break existing builds.\n\n### The `visibility` field\n\nBy default, packages published to Ballerina Central are public, allowing visibility to all users. To limit access, you can designate a package as private by adding the `visibility` field to the `[package]` table. Private packages are accessible only to members of the associated organization. You can configure the access token in the `<USER_HOME>/.ballerina/Settings.toml` file to utilize the package as a dependency. \n\nFor information on how to obtain an access token, see [prepare for publishing](/learn/publish-packages-to-ballerina-central/#prepare-for-publishing).\n\nBelow is an example on setting the visibility of a package to private.\n\n```toml\n[package]\norg = \"samjs\"\nname = \"winery\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nvisibility = \"private\"\n```\n\n### The `readme` field\n\nThe readme field allows you to specify the primary documentation file for your package. By default, the README.md file located at the package's root directory serves as the primary documentation. However, you can override this behavior by providing a custom path to a Markdown file in the readme field. This enables you to use a different file as the primary documentation.\n\n``` toml\n[package]\norg = \"samjs\"\nname = \"winery\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nreadme = \"docs/Reference.md\"\n```\n\n### The `icon` field\n\nThe `icon` field accepts a path to an icon. The specified icon will be packaged into the `docs/` directory of the BALA.\n\nOnly the `.png` format is supported for the icon.\n\nThe below example shows how to specify an icon for the package.\n\n```toml\n[package]\norg = \"samjs\"\nname = \"winery\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nicon = \"icon.png\"\n```\n\n### The `include` field\n\nYou can provide paths to any additional resources, which need to be packed in the BALA file during the use of the `bal pack` command.\n\nThe `include` field accepts a string array, which contains the directory or file paths to include in the BALA. The included file paths will be packaged into the root of the BALA preserving its original structure. \n\nThe paths should be relative to the package root directory and support the following patterns.\n\n```toml\ninclude = [\n    \"foo\", # Any file/dir named 'foo'.\n    \"/bar\", # Any file/dir named `bar` in the root dir of the package.\n    \"baz/\", # Directories named `baz` (files are ignored).\n    \"/qux/\", # Any dir named `qux` in the root dir.\n    \"*.html\", # Any file with the `.HTML` extension. \n    \"foo*bar.*\", # Any file that has a name starting with `foo`,\n                 # ending with `bar`,\n                 # with any no of characters in the middle, \n                 # and ending with an extension after a dot.\n    \"plug?\", # Any file/dir named `plug` followed by a single character\n                # (e. g., 'plugr', 'plugz').\n    \"thud[ab]\", # Any file/dir named `thuda` or `thudb`.\n    \"fred[q-s]\", # Any file/dir named `fredq` to `thuds` in alphabetical order.\n    \"**/grault/garply\", # A file/dir that has '/grault/garply' at the end of their paths.\n    \"waldo/xyzzy/**\", # A file/dir that has `waldo/xyzzy/` at the beginning\n                      # followed by the rest of the path.\n    \"babble/**/bar\", # A path that has `babble` followed by any path in the middle\n                     # ending with `bar`.\n    \"*.rs\", # Files that has the `.rs` extension.\n    \"!corge.rs\", # Exclude the `corge.rs` file from the selected paths of the patterns above.\n    \"include-resources/thud\", # Direct dir path from the root is acceptable.\n    \"include-resources/x.js\", # Direct file path from the root is acceptable.\n    ]\n\n```\nThe below example shows how a custom directory can be included in the BALA.\n\n```toml\n[package]\norg = \"samjs\"\nname = \"winery\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ninclude = [\"documents\", \"sample.png\"]\n```\n\n### The `keywords` field\n\nThe keywords field is used to specify a list of short phrases that describe the package. Keywords are helpful for users to discover the package in the Ballerina Central using the built-in search. These keywords are also listed under the `Keywords` section on the API documentation page in Ballerina Central.\n\nThe `keywords` field is optional and accepts a string array.\n\n```toml\n[package]\norg = \"samjs\"\nname = \"winery\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nkeywords = [\"service\", \"edi\", \"manufacturing\"]\n```\n\n### The `authors` field\n\nThe `authors` field is used to specify the authors who contributed to the package. This information will be listed under the `Contributors` section on the API documentation page in Ballerina Central. \n\nThe `authors` field is optional and accepts a string array.\n\n```toml\n[package]\norg = \"samjs\"\nname = \"winery\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"John Doe\", \"Jane Doe\"]\n```\n\n### The `repository` field\n\nThe `repository` field is used to specify the URL of the repository where the source code of the package is hosted. This will be listed as `Source Repository` on the API documentation page in Ballerina Central.\n\nThe `repository` field is optional and accepts a string.\n\n```toml\n[package]\norg = \"samjs\"\nname = \"winery\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nrepository = \"https://github.com/john-doe/module-winery\"\n```\n\n### The `license` field\n\nThe `license` field is used to specify the licenses under which the package is distributed. This will be listed as `License` under the `Metadata` section on the API documentation page in Ballerina Central.\n\nThe `license` field is optional and accepts a string array.\n\n```toml\n[package]\norg = \"samjs\"\nname = \"winery\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nlicense = [\"Apache-2.0\"]\n```\n\n### Build options\n\nThe `[build-options]` table specifies options that should be applied when building the package. You can provide build options in the `Ballerina.toml` instead of passing them to the `bal build` command.\n\nBallerina supports the following build options.\n\n```toml\n[build-options]\nobservabilityIncluded = true\noffline = true\nskipTests = true\ntestReport = true\ncodeCoverage = true\ncloud = \"k8s\"\ngraalvm = true        # Enable the GraalVM image generation\ngraalvmBuildOptions = \"--option1 --option2\"        # Additional native-image options\n```\n\n### Modules\n\nThe `[[package.modules]]` array allows you to define metadata for individual modules. The following example demonstrates how to specify this information:\n\n``` toml\n[[package.modules]]\nname = \"winery.foo\"\nexport = true\nreadme = \"README.md\"\n\n[[package.modules]]\nname = \"winery.bar\"\nexport = true\nreadme = \"ModuleReference.md\"\n```\n\nThe optional export field indicates whether the module is public. Only public modules will be visible to the outside. By default, only the default module is public.\n\nThe optional readme field specifies the path to the module's documentation file in Markdown. If this field not provided, `README.md` is assumed to be the documentation file if it is available.\n\n>**Note:** Metadata for the default module is defined under the `[package]` table. Therefore, the name field in the `[[package.modules]]` array cannot match the default module name.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nWhile the Ballerina compiler resolves dependencies automatically based on the import statements, the `[[dependency]]` array can be used to specify a dependency from the local repository or to specify the minimum required version of a dependency.\n\n#### Specify a dependency from the local repository\n\nThe following example shows how a dependency from the local repository can be specified:\n\n```toml\n[[dependency]]\norg = \"ballerinax\"\nname = \"mysql\"\nversion = \"1.5.0\"\nrepository = \"local\"\n```\n\nThis will resolve the specified dependency from the local repository. For more information on how dependency resolution with the local repository works, see [Manage Dependencies](/learn/manage-dependencies/#use-dependencies-from-the-local-repository).\n\n#### Specify the minimum version for a dependency\n\nThe following example shows how the minimum version for a dependency can be specified:\n\n```toml\n[[dependency]]\norg = \"ballerinax\"\nname = \"sql\"\nversion = \"1.6.0\"\n```\n\nWith this, the compiler considers `1.6.0` as the minimum required version when resolving `ballerinax/sql`. If there are higher versions available in the Ballerina repositories, then, the latest compatible version will be resolved. To learn more about updating versions, see [Manage Dependencies](/learn/manage-dependencies/#update-dependency-versions).\n\n### Platform dependencies\n\nWhen using the `bal build` command to compile a Ballerina package, the resulting output will either be an executable JAR file or a non-executable JAR file (library package) depending on whether the package contains an entry point. These archives created by the Ballerina compiler are self-contained, meaning that they include all necessary dependencies. It may also be necessary to package external JAR files with these archives.\n\nWhen working with JAR files, it is considered a best practice to keep them organized within the package. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the dependencies. \n\n>**Note:** Additionally, it is important that Java libraries are considered platform-specific, and thereby, their location and usage should be specified in the `Ballerina.toml` file. This can be done by including a dependency on the specific JAR file as demonstrated below in the `Ballerina.toml` file. This helps the Ballerina compiler to include the relevant JAR files when creating the archive. \n\nThere are two ways to include the JAR dependency.\n\n**Use remote repositories**\n\nThe following example shows how a dependency from a public Maven repository can be specified.\n\n```toml\n[[platform.java11.dependency]]\n# Group ID of the Maven dependency.\ngroupId = \"<group-id>\"\n# Artifact ID of the Maven dependency.\nartifactId = \"<artifact-id>\"\n# Version of the Maven dependency.\nversion = \"<version>\"\n```\n\nWhen building the package, these specified Maven dependencies will be resolved and can be found in the `target/platform-libs` directory. To specify a Maven dependency in the `Ballerina.toml` file, you can use the following format.\n\nIt is also possible to use a custom repository such as a private Maven repository or Github Package repository for your dependencies by specifying it in the `Ballerina.toml` file.\n\n```toml\n[[platform.java11.repository]]\nid = \"<maven-repository-id>\"\nurl = \"<maven-repository-url>\"\nusername = \"<maven-repository-username>\"\npassword = \"<maven-repository-password>\"\n```\n\nWhen working with JAR file dependencies, it is a best practice to attach them to the default root module of your package if your package has only the default root module. This makes it easy to manage and maintain the dependencies. However, if your package is a Ballerina library package, it is recommended that you specify the JAR file dependencies in each Ballerina module that depends on the JAR file.\n\nBy default, the `bal build` command will package all JAR files specified in the `Ballerina.toml` file along with the executable JAR file. This ensures that the executable JAR file includes all necessary dependencies making the package self-contained and easy to use.\n\n**Provide the path of JAR file**\n\nYou may also store the JAR files anywhere in your file system and provide the path as shown below. \n\n```toml\n[[platform.java11.dependency]]\n# Group ID of the dependency.\ngroupId = \"<group-id>\"\n# Artifact ID of the dependency.\nartifactId = \"<artifact-id>\"\n# Version of the dependency.\nversion = \"<version>\"\n# Absolute or relative path of the JAR file.\npath = \"<path-to-jar-file-1>\"\n```\n\nThe Ballerina compiler will copy the specified JAR file from the provided path when creating the archive.\n\n**Restrict usage to specific modules**\n\nThe following example shows how you can optionally restrict the visibility of a platform dependency to a selected set of modules.\n\n```toml\n[[platform.java11.dependency]]\n# Absolute or relative path of the JAR file.\npath = \"<path-to-jar-file-1>\"\n# An optional comma-separated list of Ballerina module names (to restrict the usage of this JAR).\nmodules = [\"<ballerina-module-1>\"]\n```\n\n  It is considered a best practice to provide the names of the modules that use the JAVA library as a comma-separated list. This ensures that the JAR library is only used in the specified modules.\n\n**Resolve multiple versions of the same JAR**\n\nThere can be use cases where two different Ballerina dependencies may use the same platform library. Two platform dependency entries having the same `groupId` and the `artifactId` is considered to be the same where the latest out of the two will be picked by the compiler for creating the executable JAR. \n\nThe following example shows the recommended way for specifying a platform dependency which will help with version resolution.\n\n```toml\n[[platform.java11.dependency]]\n# Absolute or relative path of the JAR file.\npath = \"<path-to-jar-file-1>\"\n# Optional details about the dependency (to handle conflicting JAR files).\ngroupId =  \"<dependency-group-id>\"\nartifactId =  \"<dependency-artifact-id>\"\nversion =  \"<dependency-version>\"\n```\n\nWith the above approach, for example, if you are using `commons-logging-1.2.jar` in your package but there is another package in the dependency graph that uses `commons-logging-1.1.1.jar`, the compiler will pick the `commons-logging-1.2.jar` since it is the latest version. A warning will be reported in addition as shown below.\n\n```\nWARNING [mypackage] detected conflicting jar files. 'commons-logging-1.1.1.jar' dependency of 'myorg/pkg2' conflicts with 'commons-logging-1.2.jar'  dependency of 'myorg/pkg1'. Picking 'commons-logging-1.2.jar' over 'commons-logging-1.1.1.jar'.\n```\n\nNote: Ignoring the `groupId` and `artifactId` will result in picking a random jar with the following warning reported by the compiler.\n```\nwarning: Detected conflicting jar files:\n        'commons-logging-1.1.1.jar' dependency of 'myorg/pkg1' conflict with 'commons-logging-1.2.jar' dependency of 'myorg/pkg2'\n```\n\n**Define the scope for a dependency**\n\nBy default, when the scope has not been explicitly specified for a platform dependency in the `Ballerina.toml`, it will be packaged into the final executable JAR file or the BALA file. Two scopes can be used to restrict this behavior.\n\n***'testOnly' scope***\n\nTo restrict a certain platform dependency to be used only for testing, specify the scope as `testOnly`. This will add the platform dependency to the test runtime but will avoid packing it into the final executable JAR file.\n\n***'provided' scope***\n\nTo restrict a certain platform dependency from being packed into the BALA file, specify the scope as `provided`. This will add the platform dependency to the final executable JAR file but not to the BALA file.\n\nThis scope is useful in cases where the provider's license restricts the redistribution of the platform library. By specifying the \"provided\" scope, you ensure the dependency is available during both compilation and execution, without being included in the BALA. This approach helps avoid any licensing complications associated with redistribution.\n\nWhen incorporating such a BALA as a dependency in another project, remember to explicitly define the platform dependency in the `Ballerina.toml` file since it will not be bundled within the BALA file. Additionally, it is important to note that specifying the scope as 'provided' when providing platform dependencies for the bal build command is not supported.\n\nThe following example shows a platform dependency entry with the `scope`.\n\n  ```toml\n  [[platform.java11.dependency]]\n  # Absolute or relative path of the JAR file.\n  path = \"<path-to-jar-file-1>\"\n  # Scope of the JAR file\n  scope =  \"<scope-of-the-jar-file>\"\n  ```\n\n>**Note:** When the scope has been specified as `provided`, the values `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` will be considered mandatory fields for that dependency.\n\n**Mark a Java dependency as GraalVM compatible**\n\nA Java dependency can be marked as GraalVM compatible by passing the `graalvmCompatible = true` property as follows:\n\n```toml\n[[platform.java11.dependency]]\ngroupId = \"<group-id>\"\nartifactId = \"<artifact-id>\"\nversion = \"<version>\"\ngraalvmCompatible = true\n```\n\nIf all the Java dependencies used in the package are marked as GraalVM compatible, the package is considered GraalVM compatible. \n\n\n### Tools\n\nYou can specify code generation tools to integrate with the package build. These tools execute before the package build and generate code that is essential for the build process.\n\nThe following example shows how to specify a tool in the `Ballerina.toml` file.\n\n```toml\n[[tool.<command>]]\nid = \"<tool-id>\"\nfilePath = \"<schema-or-API-specification-file>\"\ntargetModule = \"<destination-module-to-generate-code>\"\noptions.<option1> = \"<value1>\"\noptions.<option2> = \"<value2>\"\n```\n\nThe tool command that you need to use should be specified after the `tool.` prefix in the table array header.\n\nThe mandatory `id` field specifies a unique identifier for the tool entry, as a tool can utilize multiple schemas/API specifications files. The `id` must consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores only, and must not begin or end with an underscore. Consecutive underscores are also not permitted.\n\nThe `filePath` field is mandatory, providing the path to the specification file that the tool uses to generate code.\n \nThe `targetModule` field specifies the module where the generated code should be placed. If this is not specified, it will default to the root module. This should be unique for each tool entry.\n \nThe `options` fields can be used to pass additional parameters to the tool.\n\nIf a tool provides multiple subcommands, you can specify them as follows.\n\n```toml\n[[tool.<command>.<subcommand1>]]\nid = \"<tool-id1>\"\nfilePath = \"<specification-file>\"\ntargetModule = \"<generated-code-destination-module>\"\noptions.<option1> = \"<value1>\"\noptions.<option2> = \"<value2>\"\n\n[[tool.<command>.<subcommand2>]]\nid = \"<tool-id2>\"\nfilePath = \"<specification-file>\"\ntargetModule = \"<generated-code-destination-module>\"\noptions.<option1> = \"<value1>\"\n```\n\n## Platform Compatibility\n\nThe compatibility of a platform with specific runtimes can be specified in the `Ballerina.toml` file using specific parameters. Currently, the `graalvmCompatible` property is supported to indicate the compatibility of a package with GraalVM for Java platforms.\n\nFor packages using `java11` platform dependencies, it can be specified as follows.\n\n  ```toml\n[platform.java11]\ngraalvmCompatible = true\n  ```\n\nIf the package does not use any Java dependencies or if only Java dependencies provided by the distribution are used, this property is automatically inferred to be `true`.\n\n## The `Dependencies.toml` file\n\nThe [`Dependencies.toml`](/learn/manage-dependencies/#specify-dependency-versions) locks the versions of the dependencies to support repeatable builds.\nThis file is auto-generated and managed by the Ballerina CLI. It does not need user intervention.\n\n## The `README.md` file\n\nThe `README.md` file provides a human-readable description of a package. This file is required for publishing a package to a repository. It is the first page you will see when you navigate to the package in <a href=\"https://central.ballerina.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Ballerina Central</a>.\n\nThis file is in markdown format. It will be auto-generated when you create a library package. For steps to create a library package, see [Create a Library Package](/learn/publish-packages-to-ballerina-central/#create-a-library-package)\n\n## The `target/` directory\n\nThe `target/` directory contains artifacts generated by building a package.\n\n## The `tests/` directory\n\nThis is a directory related to the default module. For detailed information, see [Module layout](/learn/package-references/#module-layout).\n\n## The `resources/` directory\n\nThe `resources/` directory stores package resources such as images, default configs, etc.\n\n## The `modules/` directory\n\nThis directory contains the other modules. The layout of this directory is explained in the [Module layout](/learn/package-references/#module-layout).\n\n## Module layout\n\n```\n.\n├── app.bal\n├── utils.bal\n├── tests/\n│     ├── main_tests.bal\n│     └── utils_tests.bal\n└── resources/\n      └── app.png\n```\n\n### Module directories\n\nThe root directory of the default module is the root of the package directory. The top-level `modules/` directory contains all the other modules. Each immediate subdirectory of the `modules/` directory becomes a Ballerina module. The subdirectory name becomes the module name. Therefore, the subdirectory name should be a valid Ballerina identifier.\n\nModule names can only contain alphanumerics, underscores, and periods and the maximum length is 256 characters. For the modules belonging to the same package, the value of the first identifier is the package name.\n\n```\n<package-name>[.<module-directory-name>]\n```\n\nYou can add other modules using the `bal add` command.\n\n```\n$ bal add util\n```\n\n### The `.bal` source files\n\nThe root of the module directory contains the source files of that module.\nThe package sources are the `.bal` files in the `root` directory, and `tests/` directory of the module. All other `.bal` files are treated as standalone Ballerina files.\n\n### The `tests/` directory\n\nThe `tests/` directory contains unit tests for the module and tests the module in isolation. The module-level test cases have access to the symbols with module-level visibility.\n\n## The `generated/` directory\n\nThis directory contains generated Ballerina code. The `.bal` files at the root of the generated directory become a part of the default module. Any direct subdirectory becomes a module in the package. The files will logically merge into the existing modules during compilation. Any files added to the `resources` directory within the `generated/` directory will be recognized as resources for the package.\n\n<style> #tree-expand-all , #tree-collapse-all, .cTocElements
