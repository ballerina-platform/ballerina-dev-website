Below is the TOML syntax for the proxy settings.\n\n```toml\n[proxy]\nhost = \"HOST_NAME\"\nport = PORT\nusername = \"PROXY_USERNAME\"\npassword = \"PROXY_PASSWORD\"\n```\n\nIf your proxy does not require any credentials, keep `username` and `password` fields empty as shown below.\n\n```toml\n[proxy]\nhost = \"HOST_NAME\"\nport = PORT\nusername = \"\"\npassword = \"\"\n```\n\n## Add necessary certificates to the truststore\n\nIf you encounter any certificate-related issues such as the one below when connecting via a proxy:\n\n> PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target.\n\n follow the steps below to trust the certificates associated with the proxy.\n\n1) Navigate to the `dependencies/` folder in the Ballerina installation directory. Here, you should notice one or more Java Runtime Environment (JRE) instances.\n2) Identify the certificates associated with the proxy. This information is typically found in the documentation provided by your proxy vendor.\n3) Execute the below command in a command line with administrative privileges.\n\n    ```\n    <BALLERINA_JRE>/bin/keytool.exe -import -trustcacerts -file <CERTS_PATH> -alias <ALIAS_NAME> -keystore <BALLERINA_JRE>/lib/security/cacerts\n    ```\n\n> **Note:** If you are using multiple Ballerina distributions, you may need to follow the above steps to all the JRE instances individually for each distribution.\n","id":"configure-a-network-proxy","sub":"ballerina-central","third":"","slug":"ballerina-central/configure-a-network-proxy","codes":"[[-494091890,\"<pre class=\\\"shiki github-light\\\" style=\\\"background-color: #fff\\\" tabindex=\\\"0\\\"><code><span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">[</span><span style=\\\"color: #6F42C1\\\">proxy</span><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">]</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">host = </span><span style=\\\"color: #032F62\\\">&quot;HOST_NAME&quot;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">port = P</span><span style=\\\"color: #B31D28; font-style: italic\\\">ORT</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">username = </span><span style=\\\"color: #032F62\\\">&quot;PROXY_USERNAME&quot;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">password = </span><span style=\\\"color: #032F62\\\">&quot;PROXY_PASSWORD&quot;</span></span></code></pre>\"],[1892808641,\"<pre class=\\\"shiki github-light\\\" style=\\\"background-color: #fff\\\" tabindex=\\\"0\\\"><code><span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">[</span><span style=\\\"color: #6F42C1\\\">proxy</span><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">]</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">host = </span><span style=\\\"color: #032F62\\\">&quot;HOST_NAME&quot;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">port = P</span><span style=\\\"color: #B31D28; font-style: italic\\\">ORT</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">username = </span><span style=\\\"color: #032F62\\\">&quot;&quot;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #24292E\\\">password = </span><span style=\\\"color: #032F62\\\">&quot;&quot;</span></span></code></pre>\"]]"},"__N_SSG":true}
