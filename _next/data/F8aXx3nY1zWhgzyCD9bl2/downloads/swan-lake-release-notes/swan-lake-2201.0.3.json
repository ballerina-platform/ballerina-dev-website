Run `bal update` to get the latest version of the Update Tool.\n\n2. Run `bal dist update` ( or `bal dist pull 2201.0.3`) to update your Ballerina version to 2201.0.3 (Swan Lake).\n\nHowever, if you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake) and if you already ran `bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.0.3`) before `bal update`, see [Troubleshooting](/downloads/swan-lake-release-notes/swan-lake-2201.0.0/#troubleshooting) to recover your installation.\n\n## Installing Ballerina\n\nIf you have not installed Ballerina, then download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.\n\n## Language updates\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake 2201.0.3](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3AType%2FBug+label%3ATeam%2FCompilerFE+milestone%3A%222201.0.3%22).\n\n## Runtime updates\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake 2201.0.3](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3AType%2FBug+label%3ATeam%2FjBallerina+milestone%3A%222201.0.3%22+).\n\n## Standard library updates\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake 2201.0.3](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Swan+Lake+2201.0.3%22+label%3AType%2FBug).\n\n## Developer tools updates\n\n### Improvements\n\n#### Debugger\n\nAdded rutime breakpoint verification support. With this improvement, now, the debugger will verify all the valid breakpoint locations in the current debug source. Therefore, all the breakpoints that are set on non-executable lines of code (i.e., Ballerina line comments, documentation , blank lines, declarations, etc.) will be marked as `unverified` in the editor.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the GitHub milestone for Swan Lake 2201.0.3 of the repositories below.\n\n- [Language Server](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ATeam%2FLanguageServer+milestone%3A%222201.0.3%22+label%3AType%2FBug+)\n- [Debugger](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AType%2FBug+label%3AArea%2FDebugger+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2201.0.3)\n- [OpenAPI](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/openapi-tools/milestone/15?closed=1)\n\n<!-- <style>.cGitButtonContainer, .cBallerinaTocContainer {display:none;}</style> -->\n","id":"swan-lake-2201.0.3"},"__N_SSG":true}
