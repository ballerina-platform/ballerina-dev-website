This resource will receive the user request, reserve the appointment, and send an email to the user with the appointment details.\n\nThe flow is as follows.\n\n1. Receive a request with a JSON payload in the following form.\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"patient\": {\n            \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n            \"dob\": \"1940-03-19\",\n            \"ssn\": \"234-23-525\",\n            \"address\": \"California\",\n            \"phone\": \"8770586755\",\n            \"email\": \"johndoe@gmail.com\",\n            \"cardNo\": \"7844481124110331\"\n        },\n        \"doctor\": \"thomas collins\",\n        \"hospital_id\": \"grandoaks\",\n        \"hospital\": \"grand oak community hospital\",\n        \"appointment_date\": \"2023-10-02\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Extract necessary details from the request (e.g., hospital, patient, doctor, etc.) and make a call to the hospital backend service to request an appointment. A response similar to the following will be returned from the hospital backend service on success.\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"appointmentNumber\": 1,\n        \"doctor\": {\n            \"name\": \"thomas collins\",\n            \"hospital\": \"grand oak community hospital\",\n            \"category\": \"surgery\",\n            \"availability\": \"9.00 a.m - 11.00 a.m\",\n            \"fee\": 7000.0\n        },\n        \"patient\": {\n            \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n            \"dob\": \"1940-03-19\",\n            \"ssn\": \"234-23-525\",\n            \"address\": \"California\",\n            \"phone\": \"8770586755\",\n            \"email\": \"johndoe@gmail.com\"\n        },\n        \"hospital\": \"grand oak community hospital\",\n        \"confirmed\": false,\n        \"appointmentDate\": \"2023-10-02\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Call the payment backend service to make the payment and retrieve the reservation response, which will have a payload similar to that shown below. If the payment is successful, send an email to the user with the appointment details.\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"appointmentNo\": 1,\n        \"doctorName\": \"thomas collins\",\n        \"patient\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"actualFee\": 7000,\n        \"discount\": 20,\n        \"discounted\": 5600.0,\n        \"paymentID\": \"8458c75a-c8e0-4d49-8da4-5e56043b1a20\",\n        \"status\": \"settled\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Concepts covered\n\n- REST API\n- HTTP Client\n- Email Client\n\n## Develop the application\n\n### Step 1: Set up the workspace\n\nInstall [Ballerina Swan Lake](https://ballerina.io/downloads/) and the [Ballerina Swan Lake VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wso2.ballerina) on VS Code.\n\n### Step 2: Develop the service\n\nFollow the instructions given in this section to develop the service.\n\n1. Create a new Ballerina project using the `bal` command and open it in VS Code.\n\n    ```bash\n    $ bal new sending-emails-from-a-service\n    ```\n\n2. Introduce the source code in files with the `.bal` extension (e.g., the `main.bal` file). \n\n    Import the \n    - `ballerina/email` module to send emails using the SMTP protocol\n    - `ballerina/http` module to develop the REST API and define the clients that can be used to send requests to the backend services\n    - `ballerina/log` module to log debug, error or info level information for each client request\n\n    ```ballerina\n    import ballerina/email;\n    import ballerina/http;\n    import ballerina/log;\n    ```\n\n3. Define [configurable variables](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/#configurability) for the port on which the listener should listen and the URLs of the backend services. Also, define configurable variables for the host, username, and password of the SMTP client.\n\n    > **Note:** Enable two-factor authentication on your Google account, generate an app password, and use the app password in place of your email password. The app password can be generated with [this link](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords?pli=1&rapt=AEjHL4Mf5XDD4rE79YJpP5E2NoNwhvXMET_TWyBcQRn-HMzt0PI8BmptpMGRiBVIamW-0ECgVZtXxMRA19bL4Wfnq_hmjBEMqA).\n\n    ```ballerina\n    configurable int port = 8290;\n    configurable string hospitalServicesBackend = \"http://localhost:9090\";\n    configurable string paymentBackend = \"http://localhost:9090/healthcare/payments\";\n    configurable string host = \"smtp.gmail.com\";\n    configurable string username = ?;\n    configurable string password = ?;\n    ```\n\n4. Define two [`http:Client`](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/#http-client) clients to send requests to the backend services and one [`email:SmtpClient`](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/#email-client) client to send emails.\n\n    ```ballerina\n    final http:Client hospitalServicesEP = check initializeHttpClient(hospitalServicesBackend);\n    final http:Client paymentEP = check initializeHttpClient(paymentBackend);\n    final email:SmtpClient smtpClient = check initializeEmailClient();\n\n    function initializeHttpClient(string url) returns http:Client|error => new (url);\n\n    function initializeEmailClient() returns email:SmtpClient|error => new (host, username, password);\n    ```\n\n    > **Note:** The argument to the `new` expression is the URL for the backend service. \n    > \n    > Alternatively, the clients can be initialized directly with `new` expressions, but a separate function is used to aid with testing.\n    > \n    > ```ballerina\n    > final http:Client hospitalServicesEP = check new (hospitalServicesBackend);\n    > final http:Client paymentEP = check new (paymentBackend);\n    > ```\n\n5. Define records corresponding to the request payload and response payloads.\n\n    ```ballerina\n    type Patient record {|\n        string name;\n        string dob;\n        string ssn;\n        string address;\n        string phone;\n        string email;\n    |};\n\n    type Doctor record {|\n        string name;\n        string hospital;\n        string category;\n        string availability;\n        decimal fee;\n    |};\n\n    type Appointment record {|\n        int appointmentNumber;\n        Doctor doctor;\n        Patient patient;\n        boolean confirmed;\n        string hospital;\n        string appointmentDate;\n    |};\n\n    type PaymentSettlement record {|\n        int appointmentNumber;\n        Doctor doctor;\n        Patient patient;\n        decimal fee;\n        boolean confirmed;\n        string card_number;\n    |};\n\n    type Payment record {|\n        int appointmentNo;\n        string doctorName;\n        string patient;\n        decimal actualFee;\n        int discount;\n        decimal discounted;\n        string paymentID;\n        string status;\n    |};\n\n    type ReservationRequest record {|\n        record {|\n            *Patient;\n            string cardNo;\n        |} patient;\n        string doctor;\n        string hospital_id;\n        string hospital;\n        string appointment_date;\n    |};\n\n    type ReservationResponse record {|\n        int appointmentNo;\n        string doctorName;\n        string patient;\n        decimal actualFee;\n        int discount;\n        decimal discounted;\n        string paymentID;\n        string status;\n    |};\n    ```\n\n   - The `ReservationRequest` record uses [record type inclusion](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/type-inclusion-for-records/) in the type of the `patient` field to include all the fields from the `Patient` record along with the `cardNo` field.\n\n   - The initial record definitions can be generated using the \"Paste JSON as record\" VSCode command with the relevant JSON payloads and the records can then be modified as necessary.\n\n6. Define the [HTTP service (REST API)](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/#rest-service) that has the resource function that accepts user requests, makes calls to the backend services to retrieve relevant details, and sends emails to the client with appointment details.\n\n    ```ballerina\n    service /healthcare on new http:Listener(port) {\n        resource function post categories/[string category]/reserve(ReservationRequest payload) \n                returns http:Created|http:NotFound|http:InternalServerError {\n            \n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n   - Use `/healthcare` as the service path (or the context) for the service attached to the listener that is listening on port `port`.\n     \n   - The HTTP resource allows the `POST` operation on resource path `/categories/{category}/reserve`, where `category` (corresponding to the specialization) is a path parameter.\n\n   - Use `ReservationRequest` as a parameter indicating that the resource expects a JSON object corresponding to `ReservationRequest` as the payload. \n\n   - Use `http:Created|http:NotFound|http:InternalServerError` as the return type to indicate that the response will be an `http:Created` response when the email is sent successfully to the user or the response will be an `http:NotFound` or `http:InternalServerError` response on error.\n\n7. Implement the logic.\n\n    ```ballerina\n    service /healthcare on new http:Listener(port) {\n\n        resource function post categories/[string category]/reserve(ReservationRequest payload)\n                returns http:Created|http:NotFound|http:InternalServerError {\n\n            ReservationRequest {\n                patient: {cardNo, ...patient},\n                doctor,\n                hospital,\n                hospital_id,\n                appointment_date\n            } = payload;\n\n            Appointment|http:ClientError appointment =\n                    hospitalServicesEP->/[hospital_id]/categories/[category]/reserve.post({\n                patient,\n                doctor,\n                hospital,\n                appointment_date\n            });\n\n            if appointment !is Appointment {\n                log:printError(\"Appointment reservation failed\", appointment);\n                if appointment is http:ClientRequestError {\n                    return <http:NotFound>{body: string `unknown hospital, doctor, or category`};\n                }\n                return <http:InternalServerError>{body: appointment.message()};\n            }\n\n            int appointmentNumber = appointment.appointmentNumber;\n\n            Payment|http:ClientError payment = paymentEP->/.post({\n                appointmentNumber,\n                doctor: appointment.doctor,\n                patient: appointment.patient,\n                fee: appointment.doctor.fee,\n                confirmed: appointment.confirmed,\n                card_number: cardNo\n            });\n\n            if payment !is Payment {\n                log:printError(\"Payment settlement failed\", payment);\n                if payment is http:ClientRequestError {\n                    return <http:NotFound>{body: string `payment failed: unknown appointment number`};\n                }\n                return <http:InternalServerError>{body: payment.message()};\n            }\n\n            email:Error? sendMessage = smtpClient->sendMessage({\n                to: patient.email,\n                subject: \"Appointment reservation confirmed at \" + hospital,\n                body: getEmailContent(appointmentNumber, appointment, payment)\n            });\n\n            if sendMessage is email:Error {\n                return <http:InternalServerError>{body: sendMessage.message()};\n            }\n            log:printDebug(\"Email sent successfully\",\n                            name = patient.name,\n                            appointmentNumber = appointmentNumber);\n            <http:Created>{};\n        }\n    }\n\n    function getEmailContent(int appointmentNumber, Appointment appointment, Payment payment)\n            returns string =>\n        let Patient patient = appointment.patient, Doctor doctor = appointment.doctor in\n        string `Appointment Confirmation\n\n        Appointment Details\n            Appointment Number: ${appointmentNumber}\n            Appointment Date: ${appointment.appointmentDate}\n\n        Patient Details\n            Name: ${patient.name}\n            Contact Number: ${patient.phone}\n\n        Doctor Details\n            Name: ${doctor.name}\n            Specialization: ${doctor.category}\n\n        Payment Details\n            Doctor Fee: ${payment.actualFee}\n            Discount: ${payment.discount}\n            Total Fee: ${payment.discounted}\n            Payment Status: ${payment.status}`;\n    ```\n\n   - The first backend call is a `POST` request to the hospital service to reserve the appointment. The `hospital_id` and `category` values are used as path parameters.\n\n       ```ballerina\n       Appointment|http:ClientError appointment =\n               hospitalServicesEP->/[hospital_id]/categories/[category]/reserve.post({\n           patient,\n           doctor,\n           hospital,\n           appointment_date\n       });\n       ```\n\n   - Use the `is` check to decide the flow based on the response to the client call. If the request failed, return an `http:NotFound` response. Else, if the payload could not be bound to `Appointment` as expected or if there were any other failures, respond with an `http:InternalServerError` response.\n\n       ```ballerina\n       if appointment !is Appointment {\n           log:printError(\"Appointment reservation failed\", appointment);\n           if appointment is http:ClientRequestError {\n               return <http:NotFound>{body: string `unknown hospital, doctor, or category`};\n           }\n           return <http:InternalServerError>{body: appointment.message()};\n       }\n       ```\n\n   - If the appointment reservation was successful, we can make the payment by making a `POST` request to the payment service. The payload includes details extracted out from the original request (for `card_number`) and the appointment reservation response (for `appointmentNumber`, `doctor`, `patient`, `fee`, and `confirmed`).\n\n       ```ballerina\n       Payment|http:ClientError payment = paymentEP->/.post({\n           appointmentNumber,\n           doctor: appointment.doctor,\n           patient: appointment.patient,\n           fee: appointment.doctor.fee,\n           confirmed: appointment.confirmed,\n           card_number: cardNo\n       });\n\n       if payment !is Payment {\n           log:printError(\"Payment settlement failed\", payment);\n           if payment is http:ClientRequestError {\n               return <http:NotFound>{body: string `payment failed: unknown appointment number`};\n           }\n           return <http:InternalServerError>{body: payment.message()};\n       }\n       ```\n\n   - If the payment was successful, the next and final step is to send an email to the user with the appointment details.

Install and set up [cURL](https://curl.se/) as your client.\n\n2. Create a file named `request.json` with the request payload.\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"patient\": {\n            \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n            \"dob\": \"1940-03-19\",\n            \"ssn\": \"234-23-525\",\n            \"address\": \"California\",\n            \"phone\": \"8770586755\",\n            \"email\": \"johndoe@gmail.com\",\n            \"cardNo\": \"7844481124110331\"\n        },\n        \"doctor\": \"thomas collins\",\n        \"hospital_id\": \"grandoaks\",\n        \"hospital\": \"grand oak community hospital\",\n        \"appointment_date\": \"2023-10-02\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Execute the following command.\n\n    ```bash\n    curl -v -X POST --data @request.json http://localhost:8290/healthcare/categories/surgery/reserve --header \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n    ```\n\n#### Verify the email\n\nYou will receive an email with information similar to the following for a successful appointment reservation.\n\n```\nAppointment Confirmation\n\n    Appointment Details\n        Appointment Number: 1\n        Appointment Date: 2023-10-02\n\n    Patient Details\n        Name: John Doe\n        Contact Number : 8770586755\n\n    Doctor Details\n        Name: thomas collins\n        Specialization: surgery\n\n    Payment Details\n        Doctor Fee: 7000.0\n        Discount: 20\n        Total Fee: 5600.0\n        Payment Status: settled\n```\n\n## Complete
