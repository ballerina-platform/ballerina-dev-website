This view highlights the exact lines where problems were detected, along with a description, and the severity level.\n\n![scan-report-file-view](/learn/images/scan-tool-html-report-file-view.png)\n\n### List all available analysis rules\n\nIf youâ€™d like to explore the full set of rules the tool can apply, run the following command.\n\n```\n$ bal scan --list-rules\n```\n\nThis will display a comprehensive list of available rules for your project, which you can include or exclude in future scans.\n\nThe output will look something like this.\n\n![list-rules](/learn/images/scan-tool-list-rules.png)\n\n> **Note:** The list of displayed rules is specific to the current Ballerina project and is determined based on its dependencies.\n\n### Run analysis for specific rules\n\nIf you want to apply a specific set of rules, list them as a comma-separated string by specifying the rule ID.\n\n```\n$ bal scan --include-rules=\"ballerina:1, ballerina/io:2\"\n```\n\nTo ignore a specific set of rules during the analysis, use the following command.\n\n```\n$ bal scan --exclude-rules=\"ballerina:1, ballerina/io:2\"\n```\n\n## Publish static code analysis reports to SonarQube\n\nSonarQube is a popular open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It provides static code analysis, code coverage, and other features to help developers maintain clean, maintainable codebases. The Ballerina scan tool can be integrated with SonarQube to publish static code analysis reports, enabling seamless integration into your CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThis guide walks you through the process of configuring SonarQube and publishing Ballerina static code analysis reports.\n\n### Prerequisites\n- SonarQube 9.9 LTA Community Edition installed.\n- SonarScanner CLI 4.8.0 or later installed, and added to your system `PATH`.\n- [SonarQube Ballerina plugin](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/sonar-ballerina/packages/2580146), and [SonarQube platform plugin](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/sonar-ballerina/packages/2580149) downloaded.\n\n### Configure the SonarQube server\n\n1. Install [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/en-gb/temurin/releases/?version=17) in your machine.\n   - If Java 17 is not the default Java installation, override it.\n\n      **For Unix/macOS:**\n      ```\n      export SONAR_JAVA_PATH=\"path/to/java17_home/bin/java\"\n      ```\n\n      **For Windows:**\n      ```\n      setx SONAR_JAVA_PATH=\"path\\to\\java17_home\\bin\\java\"\n      ```\n\n2. Setup SonarQube 9.9 LTA\n   - Download SonarQube 9.9 LTA from [here](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/downloads/historical-downloads/).\n   - Extract the downloaded zip file.\n\n3. Add the [SonarQube Ballerina plugin](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/sonar-ballerina/packages/2580146).\n   - Download the latest Ballerina SonarQube plugin JAR.\n   - Place the JAR file into the `extensions/plugins/` directory of your SonarQube installation.\n\n4. Navigate to the appropriate `bin/<OS>/` directory and run the SonarQube server.\n   ```\n   $ ./sonar.sh start\n   ```\n\n   You can access the SonarQube dashboard at http://localhost:9000 once the server is up.\n\n5. Create a new project in SonarQube.\n   - Log in to the SonarQube dashboard.\n   - Click on `Create Project`.\n   - Follow the prompts to set up your project.\n\n6. Install and configure SonarScanner CLI.\n   - Download SonarScanner CLI from [here](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/9.9/analyzing-source-code/scanners/sonarscanner/).\n   - Add it to your system `PATH`.\n   - Ensure `sonar.host.url` is set correctly (either via a properties file or CLI parameter).\n\n### Configure the Ballerina project\n\n1. Download the [SonarQube platform plugin](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/sonar-ballerina/packages/2580149).\n\n2. Create a `sonar-project.properties` file at the root of your Ballerina project with the following content.\n   ```properties\n   sonar.projectKey=<your-project-key>\n   sonar.projectName=<your-project-name>\n   ```\n\n3. Create a Scan.toml at the root of your Ballerina project. Add additional SonarQube configurations by referencing the `sonar-project.properties` file.\n   ```toml\n   [[platform]]\n   name = \"sonarqube\"\n   path = \"<path-to-sonar-platform-plugin>\"\n   sonarProjectPropertiesPath = \"<path-to-sonar-project.properties>\"\n   ```\n\n### Publish reports to SonarQube\n\n1. Link a ballerina source repo to the SonarQube server from a DevOps platform or manually.\n\n2. Authenticate using a token.\n   - Generate a token from the `My Account`->`Security` section in the SonarQube UI.\n   - Set the token as an environment variable.\n\n      **For Unix/macOS:**\n      ```\n      $ export SONAR_TOKEN=<your-token>\n      ```\n\n      **For Windows:**\n      ```\n      $ set SONAR_TOKEN=<your-token>\n      ```\n\n3. Run the scan tool to publish the reports to SonarQube.\n   ```\n   $ bal scan\n   ```\n\n### After the scan\n- Once the scan completes, navigate to your project in the SonarQube dashboard.\n- View issues, vulnerabilities, code smells, and other static analysis results directly from the SonarQube UI.\n","id":"scan-tool","sub":"additional-tools","third":"","slug":"additional-tools/scan-tool","codes":"[[169635856,\"<pre class=\\\"shiki github-light\\\" style=\\\"background-color:#fff;color:#24292e\\\" tabindex=\\\"0\\\"><code><span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">sonar.projectKey</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">=&#x3C;your-project-key></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">sonar.projectName</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">=&#x3C;your-project-name></span></span></code></pre>\"],[-1557722917,\"<pre class=\\\"shiki github-light\\\" style=\\\"background-color:#fff;color:#24292e\\\" tabindex=\\\"0\\\"><code><span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">[[</span><span style=\\\"color:#6F42C1\\\">platform</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">]]</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">name = </span><span style=\\\"color:#032F62\\\">\\\"sonarqube\\\"</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">path = </span><span style=\\\"color:#032F62\\\">\\\"&#x3C;path-to-sonar-platform-plugin>\\\"</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">sonarProjectPropertiesPath = </span><span style=\\\"color:#032F62\\\">\\\"&#x3C;path-to-sonar-project.properties>\\\"</span></span></code></pre>\"]]"},"__N_SSG":true}
