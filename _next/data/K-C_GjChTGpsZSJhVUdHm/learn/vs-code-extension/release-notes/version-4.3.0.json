If there are mandatory configurable variables when you run the program via VS Code, it will prompt asking if you would like to create the `Config.toml` file. If you select **Create Config.toml**, it will create the `Config.toml` file in the package root. If a `Config.toml` file is already available, it will update it with new configurable fields. \n\n>**Tip:** The `Config.toml` file will be added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent keys from getting committed to the GitHub repository.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/release-notes/v-4.3.0/toml-config-creator.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n\n## Improvements\n\nBelow are the improvements included in this release.\n\n### GraphQL service designer\n\nA new option is added to the GraphQL service designer to filter between queries, mutations, and subscriptions.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/release-notes/v-4.3.0/graphql-filtering.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n","id":"version-4.3.0","sub":"","third":"","slug":"version-4.3.0","codes":"[]"},"__N_SSG":true}
