Language-integrated queries can process any Ballerina iterable.\n\n## Set up the prerequisites\n\nTo run this guide, you need the following prerequisites:\n\n1. [Ballerina 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)](/downloads/) or greater\n2. A text editor\n    >**Tip:** Preferably, <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Studio Code</a> with the <a href=\"https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/\" target=\"_blank\">Ballerina extension</a> installed.\n3. A command terminal\n\n## Create the Ballerina package\n\nBallerina uses packages to group code. You need to create a Ballerina package and write the business logic in it. In the terminal, execute the command below to create the Ballerina package for the implementation.\n\n> **Info:** For more information on Ballerina packages, see [Organize Ballerina code](/learn/organize-ballerina-code/).\n\n```\n$ bal new query_expressions\n```\nYou view the output below.\n\n```\nCreated new package 'query_expressions' at query_expressions.\n```\n\nThis creates a directory named `query_expressions` with the default module along with a sample code for the service as shown below. \n\n```\n.\n├── Ballerina.toml\n└── main.bal\n    \n0 directories, 2 files\n```\n\n## Create the dataset \n\nTo keep things simple, an in-memory table is used to store the COVID-19 dataset. To create the dataset, replace the `main.bal` file with the code below.\n\n```ballerina\npublic type CovidEntry record {|\n    readonly string iso_code;\n    string country;\n    decimal cases;\n    decimal deaths;\n    decimal recovered;\n    decimal active;\n|};\n\npublic final table<CovidEntry> key(iso_code) covidTable = table [\n    {iso_code: \"AFG\", country: \"Afghanistan\", cases: 159303, deaths: 7386, recovered: 146084, active: 5833},\n    {iso_code: \"SL\", country: \"Sri Lanka\", cases: 598536, deaths: 5243, recovered: 568637, active: 14656},\n    {iso_code: \"US\", country: \"USA\", cases: 69808350, deaths: 880976, recovered: 43892277, active: 25035097},\n    {iso_code: \"IND\", country: \"India\", cases: 80808350, deaths: 980976, recovered: 33892279, active: 35035095}\n];\n```\nIn this code:\n- Each record of type `CovidEntry` in the table represents the COVID-19 data related to a particular country.\n- The `iso_code` is used to uniquely identify a country and other fields are self-explanatory.\n\n## Filter the data\n\n### Create the `filterCountriesByCases` function\n\nTo define a function, which will filter out the records, which have values higher than 100,000 for the `cases` field, add the code below to the `main.bal` file.\n\n```ballerina\npublic function filterCountriesByCases(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, decimal noOfCases) returns string[] {\n    string[] filteredCountries = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        where entry.cases > noOfCases\n        select entry.country;\n    return filteredCountries;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `filterCountriesByCases` function uses a query expression to iterate the records in the `dataTable` table and filter only the records, which have more than `noOfCases` cases. A `where` clause with a condition is used to filter. \n- All records, which satisfy the condition in the `where` clause will be _selected_. \n\n### Create the `main` function\n\nTo call the `filterCountriesByCases` function from inside the `main` function, add the code below to the `main.bal` file.\n\n```ballerina\npublic function main() {\n    string[] countries = filterCountriesByCases(covidTable, 10000000);\n    io:println(\"Countries with more than 10 million cases: \", countries);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code,\n\n- The `filterCountriesByCases` function is called and `covidTable` and `10000000` are provided as parameters so that the function will filter the countries, which have more than 10000000 COVID-19 cases. \n- The next line prints the result of the function. \n\n### The complete code of the filtering function\n\nBelow is the complete code after adding the filtering function.\n\n```ballerina\npublic function filterCountriesByCases(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, decimal noOfCases) returns string[] {\n    string[] filteredCountries = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        where entry.cases > noOfCases\n        select entry.country;\n    return filteredCountries;\n}\n\npublic function main() {\n    string[] countries = filterCountriesByCases(covidTable, 10000000);\n    io:println(\"Countries with more than 10 million cases: \", countries);\n}\n```\n### Run the package for filtering\n\nIn the terminal, navigate to the `query_expressions` directory, and execute the command below to run the service package.\n\n```\n$ bal run\n```\n\n> **Info**: The console should have warning logs related to the isolatedness of resources. It is a built-in service concurrency safety feature of Ballerina.\n\nYou view the output below.\n\n```\nCompiling source\n        .../query_expressions:0.1.0\n\nRunning executable\n\nCountries with more than 10 million cases: [\"USA\",\"India\"]\n```\n\n## Sort countries by COVID-19 deaths\n\n### Create the `findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths` function\n\nTo define a new function to find the top three countries with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths, add the code below to the `main.bal` file. \n\n```ballerina\npublic function findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, int n) returns [string, decimal][] {\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        order by entry.deaths descending\n        limit n\n        select [entry.country, entry.deaths];\n    return countriesWithDeaths;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code,\n- You use another query to sort and retrieve a *limit*ed number of records from the table.\n- The `findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths` function uses a query expression to find the top three countries with the highest COVID-19 deaths. \n- The `order by` clause is used to sort the records in the table in `descending` order and the `limit` clause to limit the number of output records of the query to `n`. \n- The query produces an array of tuples of type `[string, decimal]` as the result. Each tuple contains the country name and the number of reported deaths. \n- The produced array is in descending order by the number of deaths.\n\n### Update the `main` function for sorting\n\nTo call the `findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths` function from within the `main` function to find the top three countries by the number of deaths, add the code below to the `main` function of the `main.bal` file.\n\n```ballerina\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(covidTable, 3);\n    io:println(\"Countries with highest deaths:\", countriesWithDeaths);\n```\n\n### The complete code with the sorting function \n\nBelow is the complete code after adding the sorting function.\n\n```ballerina\npublic function filterCountriesByCases(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, decimal noOfCases) returns string[] {\n    string[] filteredCountries = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        where entry.cases > noOfCases\n        select entry.country;\n    return filteredCountries;\n}\n\npublic function findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, int n) returns [string, decimal][] {\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        order by entry.deaths descending\n        limit n\n        select [entry.country, entry.deaths];\n    return countriesWithDeaths;\n}\n\npublic function main() {\n    string[] countries = filterCountriesByCases(covidTable, 10000000);\n    io:println(\"Countries with more than 10 million cases: \", countries);\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(covidTable, 3);\n    io:println(\"Countries with highest deaths:\", countriesWithDeaths);\n}\n```\n\n### Run the package for sorting\n\nIn the terminal, navigate to the `query_expressions` directory, and execute the command below to run the service package.\n\n```\n$ bal run\n```\n\nYou view the output below.\n\n```\nCompiling source\n        .../query_expressions:0.1.0\n\nRunning executable\n\nCountries with more than 10 million cases: [\"USA\",\"India\"]\nCountries with highest deaths:[[\"India\",980976],[\"USA\",880976],[\"Afghanistan\",7386]]\n```\n\n## Join with another data source\n\n### Create the `findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries` function\n\nUsing query expressions, you can join two collections and produce a new collection. The `join` operation is similar to the SQL `join` operation. To join the `covidTable` with a string array, which contains three countries, add the code below to the `main.bal` file. \n\n```ballerina\npublic function findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, string[] countries) returns [string, decimal][] {\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithRecovered = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        join string country in countries on entry.country equals country\n        select [entry.country, entry.recovered];\n    return countriesWithRecovered;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries` function uses a query expression to join the `dataTable` table with an array of strings named `countries`. The join condition is provided after the `on` keyword. \n- For every record in the `dataTable`, all the elements in the `countries` array will be joined. \n- The output array of tuples will have the country and the number of recovered patients only if the condition after the `on` keyword is satisfied for that particular pair of table records and element of the array being joined.\n\n### Update the `main` function for joining\n\nTo call the `findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries` function at the end to get the number of recovered patients, add the code below to the `main` function of the `main.bal` file. \n\n>**Info:** You will get the number of recovered patients in the USA, India, and Afghanistan. \n\n```ballerina\n    string[] c = [\"USA\", \"India\", \"Afghanistan\"];\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithRecovered = findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries(covidTable, c);\n    io:println(\"Countries with number of Recovered patients:\", countriesWithRecovered);\n```\n\n### The complete code with the joining function\n\nBelow is the complete code after adding the joining function.\n\n```ballerina\npublic function filterCountriesByCases(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, decimal noOfCases) returns string[] {\n    string[] filteredCountries = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        where entry.cases > noOfCases\n        select entry.country;\n    return filteredCountries;\n}\n\npublic function findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, int n) returns [string, decimal][] {\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        order by entry.deaths descending\n        limit n\n        select [entry.country, entry.deaths];\n    return countriesWithDeaths;\n}\n\npublic function findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, string[] countries) returns [string, decimal][] {\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithRecovered = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        join string country in countries on entry.country equals country\n        select [entry.country, entry.recovered];\n    return countriesWithRecovered;\n}\n\npublic function main() {\n    string[] countries = filterCountriesByCases(covidTable, 10000000);\n    io:println(\"Countries with more than 10 million cases: \", countries);\n\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(covidTable, 3);\n    io:println(\"Countries with highest deaths:\", countriesWithDeaths);\n\n    string[] c = [\"USA\", \"India\", \"Afghanistan\"];\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithRecovered = findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries(covidTable, c);\n    io:println(\"Countries with number of Recovered patients:\", countriesWithRecovered);\n}\n```\n\n### Run the package for joining\n\nIn the terminal, navigate to the `query_expressions` directory, and execute the command below to run the service package.\n\n```\n$ bal run\n```\n\nYou view the output below.\n\n```\nCompiling source\n        .../query_expressions:0.1.0\n\nRunning executable\n\nCountries with more than 10 million cases: [\"USA\",\"India\"]\nCountries with highest deaths:[[\"India\",980976],[\"USA\",880976],[\"Afghanistan\",7386]]\nCountries with number of Recovered patients:[[\"Afghanistan\",146084],[\"USA\",43892277],[\"India\",33892279]]\n```\n\n## Find discrepancies in the dataset\n\n### Create the `printErroneousData` function\n\nThis example shows how you can use the `let` clause to maintain an intermediate state while iterating a collection using query expression and how to use that intermediate state for further processing. For example, in this dataset, the total number of reported cases should be equal to the sum of the number of deaths, recovered, and active. If they are not equal, an error should have occurred while the dataset is populated.\n\nTo define a function called `printErroneousData` to find any erroneous records in the dataset, add the code below to the `main.bal` file.  \n\n```ballerina\npublic function printErroneousData(table<CovidEntry> dataTable) {\n\n    string[] countries = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        let decimal sum = entry.recovered + entry.deaths + entry.active\n        where entry.cases != sum\n        select entry.country;\n\n    if countries.length() > 0 {\n        io:println(\"Found erroneous entries for countries: \", countries);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- If there is any record in which the number of reported `cases` is not equal to the sum of `recovered`, `active`, and `deaths`, this function will print it.\n- Here, you use the `sum` variable to hold the results of intermediate calculations in the query expression. \n\n>**Note:** Even though this particular example uses a separate variable to demonstrate the usage of the `let` clause, you can do the calculations inline from within the `where` clause also.\n\n### Call the `printErroneousData` function\n\nTo call the `findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries` function at the end to get the number of recovered patients, add the code below to the `main` function of the `main.bal` file. \n\n```ballerina\nprintErroneousData(covidTable);\n```\n\n### The complete code \n\nBelow is the complete code after adding the finding function.\n\n```ballerina\npublic function filterCountriesByCases(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, decimal noOfCases) returns string[] {\n    string[] filteredCountries = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        where entry.cases > noOfCases\n        select entry.country;\n    return filteredCountries;\n}\n\npublic function findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, int n) returns [string, decimal][] {\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        order by entry.deaths descending\n        limit n\n        select [entry.country, entry.deaths];\n    return countriesWithDeaths;\n}\n\npublic function findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, string[] countries) returns [string, decimal][] {\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithRecovered = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        join string country in countries on entry.country equals country\n        select [entry.country, entry.recovered];\n    return countriesWithRecovered;\n}\n\npublic function printErroneousData(table<CovidEntry> dataTable) {\n\n    string[] countries = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        let decimal sum = entry.recovered + entry.deaths + entry.active\n        where entry.cases != sum\n        select entry.country;\n\n    if countries.length() > 0 {\n        io:println(\"Found erroneous entries for countries: \", countries);\n    }\n}\n\npublic function main() {\n    string[] countries = filterCountriesByCases(covidTable, 10000000);\n    io:println(\"Countries with more than 10 million cases: \", countries);\n\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(covidTable, 3);\n    io:println(\"Countries with highest deaths:\", countriesWithDeaths);\n\n    string[] c = [\"USA\", \"India\", \"Afghanistan\"];\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithRecovered = findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries(covidTable, c);\n    io:println(\"Countries with number of Recovered patients:\", countriesWithRecovered);\n\n    printErroneousData(covidTable);\n}\n```\n\n### Run the package\n\nIn the terminal, navigate to the `query_expressions` directory, and execute the command below to run the service package.\n\n```\n$ bal run\n```\n\nYou view the output below.\n\n```\nCompiling source\n        .../query_expressions:0.1.0\n\nRunning executable\n\nCountries with more than 10 million cases: [\"USA\",\"India\"]\nCountries with highest deaths:[[\"India\",980976],[\"USA\",880976],[\"Afghanistan\",7386]]\nCountries with number of Recovered patients:[[\"Afghanistan\",146084],[\"USA\",43892277],[\"India\",33892279]]\nFound erroneous entries for countries: [\"Sri Lanka\",\"India\"]\n```\n\n## Calculate the total number of deaths\n\n### Create the `getTotalNumberOfDeaths` function\n\nYou can use the `collect` clause to aggregate the input records of the query. If you use the collect clause, all the variables in the query expression become aggregated variables.\n\nThe aggregated variables can only be used in the following ways:\n1. An aggregated variable can be a rest argument to a langlib function call. It is not necessary to use the module prefix in the langlib function call. For example, you can write `sum(deaths)` instead of `int:sum(deaths)`. Essential aggregating functions such as `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, `first`, `last`, and `count` are available.\n2. An aggregated variable can be an element in a single element list constructor.\n\nIn the following example, the `deaths` variable becomes an aggregated variable. The `sum` function is used to calculate the total number of deaths.\n\nAdd the code below to the `main.bal` file to define a function to get the total number of deaths.\n\n```ballerina\npublic function getTotalNumberOfDeaths(table<CovidEntry> dataTable) returns decimal {\n    return from var {deaths} in dataTable\n            collect sum(deaths);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code,\n- The `collect` clause aggregates the input values into one group.\n- Since `deaths` becomes a sequence value, you can call the `sum` function in order to get the total number of deaths.\n\n### Update the main function for aggregation\n\nAdd the code below to the main function of the `main.bal` file to call the `getTotalNumberOfDeaths` function within the main function for finding the total number of deaths.\n\n### The complete code with the aggregating function\n\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/io;\n\npublic type CovidEntry record {|\n    readonly string iso_code;\n    string country;\n    string continent;\n    decimal cases;\n    decimal deaths;\n    decimal recovered;\n    decimal active;\n|};\n\npublic final table<CovidEntry> key(iso_code) covidTable = table [\n    {iso_code: \"AFG\", country: \"Afghanistan\", continent: \"Asia\", cases: 159303, deaths: 7386, recovered: 146084, active: 5833},\n    {iso_code: \"SL\", country: \"Sri Lanka\", continent: \"Asia\", cases: 598536, deaths: 5243, recovered: 568637, active: 14656},\n    {iso_code: \"US\", country: \"USA\", continent: \"North America\", cases: 69808350, deaths: 880976, recovered: 43892277, active: 25035097},\n    {iso_code: \"IND\", country: \"India\", continent: \"Asia\", cases: 80808350, deaths: 980976, recovered: 33892279, active: 35035095}\n];\n\npublic function filterCountriesByCases(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, decimal noOfCases) returns string[] {\n    string[] filteredCountries = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        where entry.cases > noOfCases\n        select entry.country;\n    return filteredCountries;\n}\n\npublic function findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, int n) returns [string, decimal][] {\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        order by entry.deaths descending\n        limit n\n        select [entry.country, entry.deaths];\n    return countriesWithDeaths;\n}\n\npublic function findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries(table<CovidEntry> dataTable, string[] countries) returns [string, decimal][] {\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithRecovered = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        join string country in countries on entry.country equals country\n        select [entry.country, entry.recovered];\n    return countriesWithRecovered;\n}\n\npublic function printErroneousData(table<CovidEntry> dataTable) {\n\n    string[] countries = from CovidEntry entry in dataTable\n        let decimal sum = entry.recovered + entry.deaths + entry.active\n        where entry.cases != sum\n        select entry.country;\n\n    if countries.length() > 0 {\n        io:println(\"Found erroneous entries for countries: \", countries);\n    }\n}\n\npublic function getTotalNumberOfDeaths(table<CovidEntry> dataTable) returns decimal {\n    return from var {deaths} in dataTable\n            collect sum(deaths);\n}\n\npublic function main() {\n    string[] countries = filterCountriesByCases(covidTable, 10000000);\n    io:println(\"Countries with more than 10 million cases: \", countries);\n\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithDeaths = findCountriesByHighestNoOfDeaths(covidTable, 3);\n    io:println(\"Countries with highest deaths: \", countriesWithDeaths);\n\n    string[] c = [\"USA\", \"India\", \"Afghanistan\"];\n    [string, decimal][] countriesWithRecovered = findRecoveredPatientsOfCountries(covidTable, c);\n    io:println(\"Countries with number of Recovered patients: \", countriesWithRecovered);\n\n    printErroneousData(covidTable);\n\n    decimal totalDeaths = getTotalNumberOfDeaths(covidTable);\n    io:println(\"Total number of deaths: \", totalDeaths);\n}\n```\n\n### Run the package for aggregation\n\nIn the terminal, navigate to the `query_expressions` directory, and execute the command below to run the service package.\n\n```\n$ bal run\n```\n\nYou view the output below.\n\n```\nCompiling source\n\t    .../query_expressions:0.1.0\n\nRunning executable\n\nCountries with more than 10 million cases: [\"USA\",\"India\"]\nCountries with highest deaths: [[\"India\",980976],[\"USA\",880976],[\"Afghanistan\",7386]]\nCountries with number of Recovered patients: [[\"Afghanistan\",146084],[\"USA\",43892277],[\"India\",33892279]]\nFound erroneous entries for countries: [\"Sri Lanka\",\"India\"]\nTotal number of deaths: 1874581\n```\n\n## Group the deaths by the continent\n\n### Create the `groupDeathsByContinent` function\n\nThe `group by` clause is used to group the input based on one or more `grouping-key`s. The set of variables that do not belong to `grouping-key`s become aggregated variables after the `group by` clause. \n\nThe aggregated variables can only be used in the following ways:\n1. An aggregated variable can be a rest argument to a langlib function call. It is not necessary to use the module prefix in the langlib function call. For example, you can write `sum(deaths)` instead of `int:sum(deaths)`. Essential aggregating functions such as `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, `first`, `last`, and `count` are available.\n2. An aggregated variable can be an element in a single element list constructor.\n\nAdd the following code to the `main.bal` file to define a function that groups the data by continent and retrieves the total number of deaths per continent.\n\n```ballerina\npublic function groupDeathsByContinent(table<CovidEntry> dataTable) returns record {|string continent; decimal[] cases; decimal deaths;|}[] {\n    return from var {continent, cases, deaths} in dataTable\n        group by continent\n        select {continent, cases: [cases], deaths: sum(deaths)};\n}\n```\n\nIn this code,\n- The `group by` clause is used to group the input and the `grouping-key` comes after the `group by` clause. In this example, the `continent` is the `grouping-key`. This is unique for each group and is used to group the input.\n- Since the `grouping-key` is `continent`, the input table is grouped by the `continent` in the `groupDeathsByContinent` function.\n- After creating groups based on the `continent`, the `deaths` and `cases` become sequence values for each `continent`.\n- You can call the `sum` function to get the total number of deaths per `continent`.\n- You can represent the `cases` as a list using `[cases]`.\n\n### Update the main function for grouping\n\nAdd the code below to the main function of the `main.bal` file to call the `groupDeathsByContinent` function within the main function and find the number of total deaths per `continent`.\n\n### The complete code with the grouping function\n\n```ballerina\nimport
