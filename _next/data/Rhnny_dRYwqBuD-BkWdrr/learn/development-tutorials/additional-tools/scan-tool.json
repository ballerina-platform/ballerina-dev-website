Below are various ways you can use the tool to fit your development workflow.\n\n### Scan a Ballerina project\n\nTo run a full analysis across all Ballerina files in your project, use the following command:\n\n```\n$ bal scan --scan-report\n```\n\nThis will produce the HTML report and scan results inside the `target/report` directory.\n\n### List all available analysis rules\n\nIf youâ€™d like to explore the full set of rules the tool can apply, run:\n\n```\n$ bal scan --list-rules\n```\n\nThis will display a comprehensive list of available rules for your project, which you can include or exclude in future scans.\n\n### Run analysis for specific rules\n\nIf you want to apply a specific set of rules, list them as a comma-separated string by specifying the rule ID:\n\n```\n$ bal scan --include-rules=\"ballerina:1, ballerina/io:2\"\n```\n\nTo ignore a specific set of rules during the analysis, use the following command:\n\n```\n$ bal scan --exclude-rules=\"ballerina:1, ballerina/io:2\"\n```\n","id":"scan-tool","sub":"additional-tools","third":"","slug":"additional-tools/scan-tool","codes":"[]"},"__N_SSG":true}
