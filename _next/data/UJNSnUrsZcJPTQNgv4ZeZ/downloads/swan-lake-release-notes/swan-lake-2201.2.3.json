Run `bal update` to get the latest version of the Update Tool.\n\n2. Run `bal dist update` ( or `bal dist pull 2201.2.3`) to update your Ballerina version to 2201.2.3.\n\nHowever, if you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake) and if you already ran `bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.2.3`) before `bal update`, see [Troubleshooting](/downloads/swan-lake-release-notes/swan-lake-2201.0.0#troubleshooting) to recover your installation.\n\n## Install Ballerina\n\nIf you have not installed Ballerina, then download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.\n\n## Language updates\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake 2201.2.3](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ATeam%2FCompilerFE+milestone%3A2201.2.3+is%3Aclosed+label%3AType%2FBug).\n\n## Standard library updates\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake 2201.2.3](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Swan+Lake+2201.2.3%22+label%3AType%2FBug).\n\n## Developer tools updates\n\n### New features\n\n#### Language Server\n\n* Added a new quick-fix code action to fill in the missing required fields of a mapping constructor\n* Added a new module-level completion item to generate an expression-bodied function snippet\n\n### Improvements\n\n#### OpenAPI Tool\n\nImproved the OpenAPI client configuration handling functionality. Now, the record, which contains the information for client initialization is changed from the `ClientConfig` to `ConnectionConfig`. A few of the defaultable configuration fields, which were in the `ClientConfig` have been changed to the optional fields in the `ConnectionConfig` record. Due to this change, the `ConnectionConfig` record can be defined as a configurable variable.\n\n>**Note:** Due to the above new configuration changes, it is recommended to republish the client connectors that you have already published to Ballerina Central using this release.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the GitHub milestone for Swan Lake 2201.2.3 of the repositories below.\n\n- [Project API](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AArea%2FProjectAPI+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2201.2.3+label%3AType%2FBug).\n- [Language Server](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ATeam%2FLanguageServer+milestone%3A2201.2.3+is%3Aclosed)\n- [Debugger](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2201.2.3+is%3Aclosed+label%3AArea%2FDebugger)\n- [OpenAPI Tool](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/openapi-tools/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AType%2FBug+milestone%3A%22Swan+Lake+2201.2.3%22+is%3Aclosed)","id":"swan-lake-2201.2.3"},"__N_SSG":true}
