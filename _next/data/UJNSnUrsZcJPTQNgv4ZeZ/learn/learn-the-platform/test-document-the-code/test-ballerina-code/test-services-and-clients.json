After completing tests, the services will shut down automatically.\n It allows you to send requests directly to the service to test its functionality.\n\n>**Note:** The service starts automatically, only if you have tests in the module where it is defined.\n\n***Example:***\n\nTo test a service, you can create a client in the test source, which sends requests directly to\nthe service and use the test assertion functions to assert the responses. This can be used for both\nexternal services and services defined in the package as well.\n\n***main.bal***\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/http;\n\nservice http:Service /foo on new http:Listener(9090) { \n    resource function get bar(int value) returns http:Response {\n        http:Response response = new;\n\n        if (value < 0) {\n            response.statusCode = 400;\n            response.setTextPayload(\"Incorrect ID value\");\n        } else {\n            response.statusCode = 200;\n            response.setTextPayload(\"Retrieved ID \" + value.toString());\n        }\n\n        return response;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n***main_test.bal***\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/test;\nimport ballerina/http;\n\nhttp:Client testClient = check new (\"http://localhost:9090/foo\");\n\n@test:Config {}\npublic function testGet() returns error? {\n    http:Response response = check testClient->get(\"/bar/?value=10\");\n    test:assertEquals(response.statusCode, 200);\n    test:assertEquals(response.getTextPayload(), \"Retrieved ID 10\");\n\n    response = check testClient->get(\"/bar/?value=-5\");\n    test:assertEquals(response.statusCode, 400);\n    test:assertEquals(response.getTextPayload(), \"Incorrect ID value\");\n}\n```\n\n## Test clients\n\nIn cases where a fully fledged client is already defined for a particular service, you can make use\nof `object mocking` to mock the calls to the service and return curated responses to the client.\nIt is useful when testing the full extent of the client by mocking responses that are difficult to reproduce in actual scenarios.\n It would cover a variety of cases that the client can handle without having the service to be up and running.\n\n***Example:***\nThe following is a simple example on how mocking can be used to stub responses to services that you \nmay not be able to access during the test execution.\n\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/test;\nimport ballerina/http;\n\nhttp:Client clientEndpoint = check new (\"https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/\");\n\n@test:Config {}\npublic function testGetRandomJoke() returns error? {\n    clientEndpoint = test:mock(http:Client);\n\n    test:prepare(clientEndpoint).when(\"get\").thenReturn(getMockResponse());\n\n    http:Response result = checkpanic clientEndpoint->get(\"/random\");\n    json payload = check result.getJsonPayload();\n\n    test:assertEquals(payload, {\"value\":\"When Chuck Norris wants an egg, he cracks open a chicken.\"});    \n}\n\nfunction getMockResponse() returns http:Response {\n    http:Response mockResponse = new;\n    json mockPayload = {\"value\":\"When Chuck Norris wants an egg, he cracks open a chicken.\"};\n    mockResponse.setPayload(mockPayload);\n    return mockResponse;\n}\n```\n\nTo lean more about how to use mocking to test services, see [Mocking](/learn/test-ballerina-code/mocking).\n\n## Configure services and clients\n\nService or client configurations can be defined for testing using Configurable variables.\nMaintaining a test configurable configuration allows us to re-define the host or port as required.\nFor example, when defining a service, the value for the host or port can be specified in the\n`Config.toml` file, which will be used specifically when running the tests.\n\n***main.bal***\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/http;\n\nconfigurable int port = 1234;\n\nservice http:Service /foo on new http:Listener(port) { \n    resource function get bar(int value) returns http:Response {\n        http:Response response = new;\n\n        if (value < 0) {\n            response.statusCode = 400;\n        } else {\n            response.statusCode = 200;\n        }\n\n        return response;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n***main_test.bal***\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/test;\nimport ballerina/http;\n\nconfigurable string hostName = \"http://originalService.com/foo\";\n\nhttp:Client testClient = check new (hostName);\n\n@test:Config {}\npublic function testGet() returns error? {\n    http:Response response = check testClient->get(\"/bar/?value=10\");\n    test:assertEquals(response.statusCode, 200);\n\n    response = check testClient->get(\"/bar/?value=-5\");\n    test:assertEquals(response.statusCode, 400);\n}\n```\n\nThe `Config.toml` must be placed in the `tests` folder for the values to be applied during execution.\n\n```toml\nhostName = \"http://localhost:9091/foo\"\nport = 9091\n```\n","id":"test-services-and-clients","sub":"test-document-the-code","third":"test-ballerina-code","slug":"test-document-the-code/test-ballerina-code/test-services-and-clients"},"__N_SSG":true}
