This view highlights the exact lines where problems were detected, along with a description, and the severity level.\n\n![scan-report-file-view](/learn/images/scan-tool-html-report-file-view.png)\n\n### List all available analysis rules\n\nIf youâ€™d like to explore the full set of rules the tool can apply, run:\n\n```\n$ bal scan --list-rules\n```\n\nThis will display a comprehensive list of available rules for your project, which you can include or exclude in future scans.\n\nThe output will look something like this:\n\n![list-rules](/learn/images/scan-tool-list-rules.png)\n\n> **Note:** The list of displayed rules is specific to the current Ballerina project and is determined based on its dependencies.\n\n### Run analysis for specific rules\n\nIf you want to apply a specific set of rules, list them as a comma-separated string by specifying the rule ID:\n\n```\n$ bal scan --include-rules=\"ballerina:1, ballerina/io:2\"\n```\n\nTo ignore a specific set of rules during the analysis, use the following command:\n\n```\n$ bal scan --exclude-rules=\"ballerina:1, ballerina/io:2\"\n```\n\n## Publishing static code analysis reports to SonarQube.\n\nTo learn how to publish reports to SonarQube, refer to [Configuration for Platform Plugins](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/static-code-analysis-tool/blob/main/docs/static-code-analysis-tool/ScanFileConfigurations.md#configuration-for-platform-plugins).","id":"scan-tool","sub":"additional-tools","third":"","slug":"additional-tools/scan-tool","codes":"[]"},"__N_SSG":true}
