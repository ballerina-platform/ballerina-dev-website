The different kinds of supported navigations are described in the following sections.\n\n## Go to definition\n\nThe [Go to definition](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-definition) feature navigates you to the definition of a particular symbol. For example, when you invoke the `Go To Definition` option on a function call expression, it navigates you to the definition of the function.\n\nTo go to a symbol's definition, press `F12`. Hold `Ctrl` on Windows and Linux or `⌘` on Mac and hover over the symbol to see a preview of its declaration.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/edit-the-code/code-navigation/go-to-definition.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n\n## Go to symbol\n\nThe [Go to symbol](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-symbol) feature allows you to navigate symbols inside a file.\n\nYou can navigate symbols within a file by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `O` on Windows and Linux, or `shift` + `⌘`+ `O` on a Mac.\nThe symbols can be grouped by category by typing `:`.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/edit-the-code/code-navigation/go-to-symbol.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n\n## Find all references\n\nInvoking the references (right click on a symbol and select **Find All References**) on a symbol will prompt you with all the symbol references in the current project.\n\nYou can also press `Alt` + `Shift` + `F12` on Windows and Linux, or `⌥` + `shift` + `F12` on Mac to find all references.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/edit-the-code/code-navigation/find-all-references.png\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n\n## Peek\n\nThis feature allows you to [peek](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_peek) the definition or references of a given symbol.\n\nOn Windows and Linux, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F10`, or on Mac, press `shift` + `F12` to open the peek view.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/edit-the-code/code-navigation/peek-definition.png\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n\n## Rename symbols\n\nThis feature allows you to rename symbols by renaming all the references of the particular symbol.\n\nPress `F2`, type the new desired name, and then press `Enter`. This will rename all usages of the symbol across files.\nYou can also right-click on the symbol and select **Rename Symbol** to rename it.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/edit-the-code/code-navigation/rename-symbols.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n","id":"code-navigation","sub":"","third":"","slug":"code-navigation","codes":"[]"},"__N_SSG":true}
