Learning to write them manually helps you to understand the inner workings of calling Java from Ballerina. \n\nAlternatively, you can use the [Bindgen Tool](/learn/java-interoperability-guide/the-bindgen-tool/) to generate these bindings automatically while eliminating the need for understanding the Ballerina FFI layer. It also explains how to customize the bindings generated by the Bindgen Tool.\n\n<style> #tree-expand-all , #tree-collapse-all, .cTocElements {display:none;} .cGitButtonContainer {padding-left: 40px;} </style>\n\n\n","id":"java-interoperability","sub":"java-interoperability","third":"java-interoperability-guide","slug":"java-interoperability/java-interoperability-guide/java-interoperability","codes":"[]"},"__N_SSG":true}
