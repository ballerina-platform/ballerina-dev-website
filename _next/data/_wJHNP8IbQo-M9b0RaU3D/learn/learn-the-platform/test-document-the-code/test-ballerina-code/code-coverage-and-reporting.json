The link to the file will be printed in the console at the end of the test execution.\nThe test report contains the total passed, failed, and skipped tests of the entire package and of the individual modules.\n\n***Example:***\n\n```\n$ bal test --test-report\n```\n\nA sample view of the test report is shown below.\n\n![Sample Test Report](/learn/images/test-report.gif)\n\n## Generate a code coverage report\n\nThe Ballerina test framework provides an option to analyze the code coverage of a standard Ballerina package.\nThis feature provides details about the coverage of the program source code by the tests executed.\n\nYou can pass the `--code-coverage`  flag along with the `--test-report` flag in the test execution command and\n generate the code coverage report at the end of the test execution. The generated file is an extended version of the\n  test report.\nIn addition to the test results, this file would contain details about the source code coverage at different levels.\n\n*   Package-level coverage as an average\n*   Module-level coverage as an average\n*   Individual source file coverage\n\nThe code coverage only includes the Ballerina source files being tested and not any files under the `tests` directory.\n\n***Example:***\n\n```\n$ bal test --test-report --code-coverage\n```\n\nA sample view of the code coverage report is shown below.\n\n![Sample Code Coverage](/learn/images/code-cov.gif)\n\n## Generate a JaCoCo XML report\n\nYou can pass the `--coverage-format=xml` flag along with the `--code-coverage` flag in the test execution command and\n generate the JaCoCo XML report at the end of the test execution.\n This file can be uploaded to the CI/CD tools (e.g., CodeCov) to display the coverage information for both Ballerina and\n  the native Java sources used within a Ballerina package.\n","id":"code-coverage-and-reporting","sub":"test-document-the-code","third":"test-ballerina-code","slug":"test-document-the-code/test-ballerina-code/code-coverage-and-reporting"},"__N_SSG":true}
