[Containerized Deployment](/learn/containerized-deployment): Ideal for containerized, cloud-native microservices, offering scalability and orchestration with Ballerinaâ€™s built-in support for Kubernetes and Docker artifacts.\n2. [Serverless](/learn/serverless-deployment): Suitable for event-driven, cost-critical applications where cloud providers manage the infrastructure, such as Azure Functions or AWS Lambda.\n3. [Virtual Machines or Bare Metal](/learn/virtual-machine-deployment): Provides full control over the infrastructure, making it suitable for high-performance or legacy systems requiring custom configurations or direct hardware access.\n\n\n## Compatible  Java versions\n\nThe Ballerina distribution always includes the JRE. The supported Java versions can be found in the table below.\n\n| Ballerina Swan Lake version                                                             | Compatible Java version |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Ballerina Swan Lake (2201.0.0) up to Ballerina Swan Lake Update 7 (2201.7.0)            | Java 11.x               |\n| Ballerina Swan Lake Update 8 (2201.8.0) up to Ballerina Swan Lake Update 10 (2201.10.0) | Java 17.x               |\n| Ballerina Swan Lake Update 11 (2201.11.0)                                               | Java 21.x               |\n","id":"deployment-guidelines-overview","sub":"deployment-guide","third":"","slug":"deployment-guide/deployment-guidelines-overview","codes":"[]"},"__N_SSG":true}
