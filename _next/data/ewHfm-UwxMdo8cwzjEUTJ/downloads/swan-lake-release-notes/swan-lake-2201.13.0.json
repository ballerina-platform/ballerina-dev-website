It is based on the 2024R1 version of the Language Specification.</em>\n\n## Update Ballerina\n\nUpdate your current Ballerina installation directly to 2201.13.0 using the [Ballerina Update Tool](/learn/update-tool/) as follows.\n\n1. Run `bal update` to get the latest version of the Update Tool.\n2. Run `bal dist update` to update to this latest distribution.\n\n## Install Ballerina\n\nIf you have not installed Ballerina, download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.\n\n## Language updates\n\n### New features\n\n#### Natural expressions\n\nNatural expressions have been introduced as experimental first-class syntax for natural language integrations. Natural expressions are blocks of natural language instructions that are executed at runtime with the help of a generator capable of understanding/executing the instructions in natural language (e.g., a generative AI model such as a large language model (LLM)). They are dependently typed, allowing generators to identify the required result format and bind the response to the expected type. \n\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/ai;\nimport ballerina/io;\n\n// Use the default model provider (with configuration added via a Ballerina VS Code command).\n// Alternatively, to use your own keys, use the relevant `ballerinax/ai.<provider>` (e.g., \n// `ballerinax/ai.openai`, `ballerinax/ai.anthropic`, etc.) model provider implementation.\nfinal ai:ModelProvider model = check ai:getDefaultModelProvider();\n\n// Define a type corresponding to the response you expect from the LLM.\ntype Joke record {|\n    string setup;\n    string punchline;\n|};\n\nfunction generateJoke(string subject) returns Joke|error {\n    // Use a natural expression with instruction specified in natural language.\n    // The expected type (`Joke`) is used to automatically generate the schema to\n    // be included in the request to the model. The relevant parts of the response\n    // are then extracted and parsed as a `Joke` value.\n    // A natural expression may evaluate to an `error` if the request or parsing fails.\n    Joke|error joke = \n        // The `natural` expression allows specifying natural language instructions directly.\n        natural (model) {\n            Tell me a joke about ${subject}!\n            Make it suitable for all audiences.\n        };\n    return joke;\n}\n\npublic function main() returns error? {\n    Joke jokeResponse = check generateJoke(\"programming\");\n    io:println(\"Setup: \", jokeResponse.setup);\n    io:println(\"Punchline: \", jokeResponse.punchline);\n}\n```\n\nNatural expressions can be multimodal; the model provider implementations handle insertions of document types such as `ai:ImageDocument`, `ai:AudioDocument`, and `ai:FileDocument` to transform them into the multimodal request format expected by the LLM API.\n\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/ai;\nimport ballerina/io;\n\nfinal ai:ModelProvider model = check ai:getDefaultModelProvider();\n\npublic function main() returns error? {\n    // Define an `ai:ImageDocument` value with a URL to an image.\n    ai:ImageDocument image = {\n        content: \"https://ballerina.io/img/branding/ballerina_logo_dgrey_png.png\"\n    };\n\n    // Use the `generate` method with an image document as an insertion (`${...}`).\n    // The model provider will detect the multimodal input and handle\n    // constructing the request appropriately.\n    string? description = check model->generate(`\n        Describe this image.\n        ${image}\n        \n        If it is not possible to describe the image, respond with null.`);\n\n    io:println(description);\n}\n```\n\n> Note: These examples use the default model provider. To generate the necessary configuration, open up the VS Code command palette (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` or `command` + `shift` + `P`), and run the `Configure default WSO2 Model Provider` command to add your configuration to the `Config.toml` file. If not already logged in, log in to the Ballerina Copilot when prompted. Alternatively, to use your own keys, use the relevant `ballerinax/ai.<provider>` model provider implementation.\n\n> Note: This is currently an experimental feature and requires the `--experimental` flag to be used with `bal` commands.\n\nFor more information, see [Natural Language is Code: A hybrid approach with Natural Programming](https://blog.ballerina.io/posts/2025-04-26-introducing-natural-programming/) and [Work with Large Language Models (LLMs) using natural expressions](https://ballerina.io/learn/work-with-llms-using-natural-expressions/).\n\n#### Compile-time code generation\n\nExperimental support for compile-time code generation has also been introduced as a part of [Natural Programming](https://blog.ballerina.io/posts/2025-04-26-introducing-natural-programming/). This allows users to describe what data (e.g., test data) should look like or what the implementation of a function should be in natural language in the source code, and have the data or implementation be generated at compile time with the help of a generative AI model. Inspired by literate programming, this allows for more expressive source code.\n\nCompile-time code generation is of two variants.\n\n- Data generation - `const natural` expressions\n\n    A `const natural` expression can be used to generate data (i.e., values that belong to `anydata`).\n\n    ```ballerina\n    import ballerina/test;\n\n    type Employee record {|\n        int id;\n        string name;\n        string department;\n        decimal salary;\n    |};\n\n    function filterEmployees(Employee[] employees, string department, decimal salary) \n        returns Employee[] => from Employee emp in employees\n            where emp.department == department && emp.salary > salary\n            select emp;\n\n    @test:Config\n    function testFilterEmployees() {\n        // Use a const natural expression to generate a dataset of employees.\n        Employee[] employees = const natural {\n            Generate data sets of employees with varying departments and salaries to test a \n            function that filters employees belonging to a specific department and earning \n            above a certain salary threshold.\n            \n            Use legal, finance, and tech departments with salaries ranging from 50000 to 150000.\n        };\n\n        // Define the department and salary threshold for filtering, either as hardcoded values \n        // or using `const natural` expressions.\n        string department = const natural { Select a department from legal, finance, and tech.};\n        decimal salaryThreshold = const natural { Select a salary threshold between 50000 and 150000. };\n\n        Employee[] filteredEmployees = filterEmployees(employees, department, salaryThreshold);\n\n        int currIndex = 0;\n        int filteredEmployeesLength = filteredEmployees.length();\n        foreach Employee employee in filteredEmployees {\n            if employee.department == department && employee.salary > salaryThreshold {\n                test:assertTrue(currIndex < filteredEmployeesLength);\n                test:assertExactEquals(filteredEmployees[currIndex], employee);\n                currIndex += 1;\n            }\n        }\n        test:assertEquals(currIndex, filteredEmployeesLength);\n    }\n    ```\n\n- Function generation - `@natural:code external` functions\n\n    An `external` function can be annotated with `@natural:code` with the `prompt` field describing the implementation of the function. Note that this is only allowed with projects (and not in single file mode) and the code generated for the function is persisted in the `generated` directory. Since there is no developer in the loop to review and approve the generated code during the build, some restrictions (such as limiting the organizations from which modules can be imported) have been introduced, compared to a Copilot.\n\n    ```ballerina\n    type Employee record {|\n        int id;\n        string name;\n        string department;\n        decimal salary;\n    |};\n\n    function filterEmployees(Employee[] employees, string department, decimal salary) returns Employee[] =\n        @natural:code {\n            prompt: string `Filter employees who belong to the specified department \n                                and have a salary greater than the given threshold.`\n        } external;\n    ```\n\n    Note that this currently works with the Ballerina Copilot configuration. To generate the configuration, open up the VS Code command palette (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` or `command` + `shift` + `P`), and run the `Configure default WSO2 Model Provider` command to add your configuration to the `Config.toml` file. If not already logged in, log in to the Ballerina Copilot when prompted. Use these values as the `BAL_CODEGEN_URL` and `BAL_CODEGEN_TOKEN` environment variables for compile-time code generation.\n\n### Improvements\n\n#### Improved XML parsing to support XML declarations\n\nPreviously, the `xml:fromString()` function did not capture XML declaration(`<?xml version=\"1.1\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>`) when converting a string into a xml value. With this update, the XML declaration is now correctly recognized and preserved during parsing.\n\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/io;\n\npublic function main() returns error? {\n    string str = string `<?xml version=\"1.1\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><A><B>123</B></A>`;\n    xml xmlVal = check xml:fromString(str);\n    io:println(xmlVal); // prints `<?xml version=\"1.1\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><A><B>123</B></A>` \n} \n```\n\n## Ballerina library updates\n\n### New features\n\n#### `time` package\n\n- Added support for add/subtract specified durations to/from time values.\n\n    ```ballerina\n    import ballerina/io;\n    import ballerina/time;\n\n    public function main() {\n        time:Civil civil = check time:civilFromString(\"2025-04-13T17:35:30.120Z\");\n        civil = check time:civilAddDuration(civil, {years: 1, months: 3, days: 5, hours: 6, minutes: 9, seconds: 1});\n        io:println(check time:civilToString(civil)); // Prints \"2026-07-18T23:44:31.120Z\"\n\n        time:TimeZone timeZone = check new(\"Asia/Colombo\");\n        civil = check time:civilFromString(\"2025-04-13T17:35:30.120-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]\");\n        civil = check timeZone.civilAddDuration(civil, {years: 1, months: 3, days: 5, hours: 6, minutes: 9, seconds: 1});\n        io:println(check time:civilToString(civil)); // 2026-07-19T13:14:31.120+05:30[Asia/Colombo]\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Improvements\n\n#### `oauth2` package\n\n- Added support for configuring the connection and request timeouts for the internal HTTP client.\n\n    ```ballerina\n    ClientCredentialsGrantConfig config = {\n        // ... other configurations\n        clientConfig: {\n            connectTimeout: 30,\n            reqTimeout: 60\n        }\n    };\n    ```\n\n## Developer tools updates\n\n### New features\n\n#### CLI\n\n##### Decoupled CLI tools from the distribution\n\nSupport for independent CLI tool releases has been introduced, allowing commonly used Ballerina CLI tools (`bal openapi`, `bal graphql`, `bal grpc`, `bal persist`) to be updated independently from the main Ballerina distribution. This enhancement enables faster delivery of bug fixes and new features for tools without requiring a full distribution release. \n\nBelow is an example on how to update the `openapi` tool to the latest version compatible with the current distribution.\n\n```\n$ bal tool update openapi\n```\n\n### Improvements\n\nIntroduced the `--dependency-cache` flag to `bal clean` command. This cleans the caches of the dependencies of a package in addition to the cache of the user's package.\n\n```\n$ bal clean --dependency-cache\n```\n\n## Ballerina packages updates\n\n### New features\n\n#### Introduced multi-package workspace support\n\nMulti-package workspace support has been introduced to enable developers to organize and manage multiple interdependent Ballerina packages within a single workspace in a monorepo-style structure. Dependencies within the workspace packages are resolved seamlessly without needing to publish to a package repository.\n\nBelow is an example of a multi-package workspace structure:\n\n```\nmy-workspace/\n├── Ballerina.toml          # Workspace configuration\n├── order-service/\n│   ├── Ballerina.toml      # Package configuration\n│   └── service.bal\n├── menu-service/\n│   ├── Ballerina.toml\n│   └── service.bal\n└── utils/\n    ├── Ballerina.toml\n    └── utils.bal\n```\n\nThe workspace-level `Ballerina.toml` file defines the workspace configuration with the packages to include in the workspace:\n\n```toml\n[workspace]\npackages = [\"order-service\", \"menu-service\", \"utils\"]\n```\n\nTo create a new workspace, use `bal new --workspace <workspace-name>`, which creates the workspace configuration with a sample project. Core commands such as `bal build`, `bal run`, `bal test`, and `bal pack` are also enhanced to support workspaces.\n\nFor more information, see the [Workspaces](https://ballerina.io/learn/workspaces/) documentation.\n\n### Improvements\n\n#### Improved the compilation time of consecutive builds\n\nPreviously, every invocation of `bal build` followed by `bal run` would recompile the entire project from scratch, even when no changes were made to the source files since the last build. With this update, the build system now detects unchanged projects and skips redundant compilation steps after the first build run within the next 24 hours.\n\nThe example below shows the output when sources are up to date:\n\n```\nCompiling source (UP-TO-DATE)\n\tmyorg/hello_app:0.1.0\n\nGenerating executable (UP-TO-DATE)\n\tmyorg/target/bin/hello_app.jar\n```\n\nRunning `bal clean` will delete the caches and force a full recompilation on the next build.\n\n## Bug fixes\n\nTo view all the bug fixes related to the compiler, runtime, and developer tools, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake Update 13 (2201.13.0) for Ballerina platform](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2201.13.0%20label%3AType%2FBug).\n\nTo view all the bug fixes related to the Ballerina library, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake Update 13 (2201.13.0) for Ballerina Library](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%222201.13.0%22+label%3AType%2FBug).\n","id":"swan-lake-2201.13.0","codeSnippets":"[[1112844296,\"<pre class=\\\"shiki github-light\\\" style=\\\"background-color:#fff;color:#24292e\\\" tabindex=\\\"0\\\"><code><span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">import</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\"> ballerina/ai;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">import</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\"> ballerina/io;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#6A737D\\\">// Use the default model provider (with configuration added via a Ballerina VS Code command).</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#6A737D\\\">// Alternatively, to use your own keys, use the relevant `ballerinax/ai.&#x3C;provider>` (e.g., </span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#6A737D\\\">// `ballerinax/ai.openai`, `ballerinax/ai.anthropic`, etc.) model provider implementation.</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">final</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\"> ai</span><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">:</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">ModelProvider model </span><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">=</span><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\"> check</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\"> ai</span><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">:</span><span style=\\\"color:#6F42C1\\\">getDefaultModelProvider</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">();</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#6A737D\\\">// Define a type corresponding to the response you expect from the LLM.</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">type</span><span style=\\\"color:#6F42C1\\\"> Joke</span><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\"> record</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\"> {</span><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">|</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#005CC5\\\">    string</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\"> setup;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#005CC5\\\">    string</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\"> punchline;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">|</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">};</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">function</span><span style=\\\"color:#6F42C1\\\"> generateJoke</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">(</span><span style=\\\"color:#005CC5\\\">string</span><span style=\\\"color:#E36209\\\"> subject</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\">) </span><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">returns</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\"> Joke</span><span style=\\\"color:#D73A49\\\">|error</span><span style=\\\"color:#24292E\\\"> {</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#6A737D\\\">    // Use a natural expression with instruction specified in natural language.</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#6A737D\\\">    // The expected type (`Joke`) is used to automatically generate the schema to</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"line\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#6A737D\\\">    // be included in the request to the model.
