The released versions of the specification can be found under the relevant Github tag.\n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions about the library, start a discussion via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues) or in the [Slack channel](https://ballerina.io/community/). Based on the outcome of the discussion, the specification and implementation can be updated. Community feedback is always welcome. Any accepted proposal, which affects the specification is stored under `/docs/proposals`. Proposals under discussion can be found with the label `type/proposal` in Github.\n\nThe conforming implementation of the specification is released and included in the distribution. Any deviation from the specification is considered a bug.\n\n## Contents\n\n1. [Overview](#1-overview)\n2. [Logging](#2-logging)\n3. [Configure Logging](#3-configure-logging)\n4. [Writing Logs to a File](#4-writing-logs-to-a-file)\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis specification elaborates on the functionalities available in the Log library. The Ballerina log module has four log levels with their priority in descending order as follows.\n```\n1. ERROR\n2. WARN\n3. INFO\n4. DEBUG\n```\n\n## 2. Logging\nThe Ballerina log module has 4 functions to log at the 4 levels; `printDebug()`, `printError()`, `printInfo()`, and `printWarn()`.\n```ballerina\nlog:printDebug(\"debug log\");\nlog:printError(\"error log\");\nlog:printInfo(\"info log\");\nlog:printWarn(\"warn log\");\n```\n\nOptionally, an error can be passed to the functions.\n```ballerina\nerror e = error(\"something went wrong!\");\nlog:printError(\"error log with cause\", 'error = e);\n```\n\nThis will print the error message. In order to print the complete error stack traces, users need to pass the error stack trace as a key-value pair which will be discussed in the next section.\n\nUsers can pass any number of key/value pairs, which need to be displayed in the log message. The value can be of `anydata` type, a function pointer or an error stack trace.\n```ballerina\nlog:printInfo(\"info log\", id = 845315, name = \"foo\", successful = true);\n```\n\n```ballerina\nlog:printInfo(\"info log\", current_time = isolated function() returns string { return time:utcToString(time:utcNow());});\n```\n\n```ballerina\nerror e = error(\"bad sad\");\nlog:printError(\"error log\", stackTrace = e.stackTrace());\n```\n\n## 3. Configure Logging\nOnly the `INFO` and higher level logs are logged by default. The log level can be configured via a Ballerina configuration file.\nTo set the global log level to a different level (eg: `DEBUG`), place the entry given below in the `Config.toml` file.\n```\n[ballerina.log]\nlevel = \"DEBUG\"\n```\n\nEach module can also be assigned its own log level. To assign a log level to a module, provide the following entry in the `Config.toml` file.\n```\n[[ballerina.log.modules]]\nname = \"[ORG_NAME]/[MODULE_NAME]\"\nlevel = \"[LOG_LEVEL]\"\n```\n\nBy default, log messages are logged to the console in the LogFmt format. To set the output format to JSON, place the entry given below in the `Config.toml` file.\n```\n[ballerina.log]\nformat = \"json\"\n```\n\n## 4. Writing Logs to a File\nBy default, logs are printed to the console. Users can set the output to a log file by providing an output file (with `.log` extension) to `log:setOutputFile()` function.\nNote that all the subsequent logs of the entire application will be written to this file.\n```ballerina\nvar result = log:setOutputFile(\"./resources/myfile.log\");\n```\n\nThere are 2 options when writing to a file.\n```\nOVERWRITE - Truncate the existing content\nAPPEND - Append to the existing content\n```\n\nThe following overwrites an existing log file.\n```ballerina\nvar result = log:setOutputFile(\"./resources/myfile.log\", log:OVERWRITE);\n```\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
