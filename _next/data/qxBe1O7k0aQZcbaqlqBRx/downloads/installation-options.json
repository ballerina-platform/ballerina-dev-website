The installer will automatically set the latest version as the active distribution after the installation.\n\n>**Info:** Ballerina installers support operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, macOS, and CentOS. If you are using an unsupported operating system, [install via the Ballerina language ZIP file](#install-via-the-ballerina-language-zip-file).\n\n### Install on macOS\n\n[Download the package file](/downloads) and double-click on it to launch the installer. The installer guides you through the installation process and installs the Ballerina distribution in the `/Library/Ballerina` directory.\n\nThe package automatically sets your `PATH` environment variable for you. You may need to restart any open terminal sessions for the change to take effect.\n\n#### Install via Homebrew\n\nAlternatively, you can install Ballerina using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by executing the commands below.\n\n```\n$ brew install bal\n```\n\nHomebrew installs the Ballerina distribution in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/usr/local/Cellar/ballerina/&lt;BALLERINA-VERSION&gt;/libexec</code> directory.\n\n### Install on Windows\n\n[Download the MSI file](/downloads) and double-click on it to launch the installer. The installer guides you through the installation process and installs the Ballerina distribution in the `C:\\Program Files\\Ballerina` directory.\n\nThe installer sets the `C:\\Program Files\\Ballerina\\<BALLERINA-DIRECTORY>\\bin` directory in your PATH environment variable. You may have to restart any open command prompts for the change to take effect.\n\n### Install on Linux\n\n[Download the DEB file or RPM file](/downloads) and double-click on it to launch the installer. The installer guides you through the installation process and installs the Ballerina distribution in the following directory.\n- For DEB file:  `/usr/lib/ballerina`\n- For RPM file:  `/usr/lib64/ballerina`\n\n> **Info:** Alternatively, you can use either of the commands below to install Ballerina using the downloaded DEB or RPM file. Replace the `ballerina-<BALLERINA-VERSION>-linux-x64.deb` or `ballerina-<BALLERINA-VERSION>-linux-x64.rpm` with the actual file path. \n\nFor example, for the DEB file:\n```\n$ dpkg -i ballerina-<VERSION>-swan-lake-linux-x64.deb \n```\n\nFor example, for the RPM file:\n```\n$ rpm -i ballerina-<VERSION>-swan-lake-linux-x64.rpm \n```\n\n## Install via the Ballerina language ZIP file\n\n> **Note:** Before you install Ballerina using the ZIP file, ensure that you have a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. It is recommended to use the <a href=\"https://adoptopenjdk.net\" target=\"_blank\">AdoptOpenJRE</a> for Ballerina. The required Java version depends on the update version, as shown below.\n\n**Update Versions**|**Java version**\n:-----:|:-----:\nUpdate 7 or below| 11\nUpdate 8, 9 and 10| 17\nUpdate 11 and above| 21\n\n1. <a id=\"packWindows\" href=\"{{ dist_server }}/downloads/{{ version }}/{{ other-artefacts | first }}\" class=\"cGTMDownload cDownload\" data-download=\"downloads\" data-pack=\"{{ zip-installer }}\"> Download the Ballerina language ZIP file </a> and unzip it to a preferred location using an archiver tool of your choice. This creates a directory named `ballerina-<VERSION>` in your system.\n\n2. Follow either of the steps below depending on your operating system to configure your system environment to run Ballerina:\n    - **For Linux or macOS:** \n        - set the PATH environment variable to point to the `bin` directory of the unzipped Ballerina distribution.\n            ```\n            $ PATH=<YOUR_LOCATION>/ballerina-<VERSION>/bin:$PATH;\n            $ export PATH;\n            ```\n        - set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your Java installation directory or to the root directory of the installed JRE. \n    - **For Windows:** add a new environment variable specifying the following values:\n        - set the `PATH` environment variable to point to the `bin` directory of the unzipped Ballerina distribution.\n            - **Variable name:** PATH\n            - **Variable value:** The location of the `bin` directory of the unzipped Ballerina distribution. For example, `C:\\Program Files\\Ballerina\\ballerina-<VERSION>\\bin`\n        - set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your Java installation directory or to the root directory of the installed JRE.\n\n\n## Verify the installation\n\nAfter installing Ballerina, run the following test to verify if Ballerina has been successfully installed. \n\nExecute the command below from the command shell of the operating system.\n\n```\n$ bal version\n```\n\nMake certain the command output shows the version that you downloaded as shown below.\n\n```\nBallerina <VERSION> (Swan Lake Update <MINOR_VERSION>)\nLanguage specification <SPEC_VERSION>\nUpdate Tool <UPDATE_TOOL_VERSION>\n```\n\n## Build from source\n\nFor instructions, see [Build Ballerina from source](/downloads/installation-options/build-ballerina-from-source/).\n\n## Update Ballerina\n\nIf you already have a Ballerina version above 1.1.0 installed, you can use the update tool to update to the latest Ballerina version and set it as the active version by executing either of the commands below.\n\n> **Info:** You might need to first update the update tool to its latest version.
