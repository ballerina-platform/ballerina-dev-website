{"pageProps":{"patterns":[{"tagline":"Add data to message","desc":"Content enricher adds data that was not sent by the original sender to the message.","helps":"Ballerina enables additional lookups to enrich the message, such as database lookups, REST API calls, etc. Spread operator (...) helps to create new records out of existing records while enriching them with additional data.","tags":["Content Enricher","Message Channel","Message Endpoint","Message"],"link":"https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/DataEnricher.html","name":"Content Enricher"},{"tagline":"Remove data from message","desc":"The content filter removes data from the original message and can also be employed to simplify the message structure.","helps":"Ballerina excels at manipulating data and handling diverse formats, structures, and transformations. The [query expression](/learn/by-example/query-expressions/) (`from` keyword) is useful for transforming messages. The `select` clause, as shown below, can be used to create new records from existing ones while refining data. The `where` clause can be used to filter items from an array.","tags":["Content Filter","Message Channel","Message Endpoint"],"link":"https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ContentFilter.html","name":"Content Filter"},{"tagline":"Transfer data to another application","desc":"The document message transfers data from one application to another. The focus is on the data and reliability, not on the timing of the transfer.","helps":"Ballerina supports sending and receiving data in multiple formats such as JSON and XML over different protocols such as HTTP, GRPC, Kafka, etc. Depending on the protocol, Ballerina provides different reliability mechanisms. As an example, the Ballerina HTTP client supports retries, load balancing, and circuit breaking.","tags":["Document Message","Message Channel","Message Endpoint","Point-to-Point Channel","Request-Reply"],"link":"https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/DocumentMessage.html","name":"Document Message"},{"tagline":"Route messages to different output channels","desc":"Message router consumes a message from one channel and republishes it to a different channel depending on a set of conditions.","helps":"Ballerina supports conditional logic with if-else and match statements. This can be used to route messages based on message content, header, or any custom logic. Ballerina type system supports union types (e.g.: Country type below) which helps to define choices in a type-safe and readable manner.","tags":["Message Router","Message Channel","Message Endpoint","Message"],"link":"https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageRouter.html","name":"Message Router"},{"tagline":"Send large data sets in chunks","desc":"Message sequence sends the data as a sequence of messages and marks each message with sequence identification fields.","helps":"Ballerina supports loop constructs such as while, foreach, and map. These constructs can be used to iterate over data and send it in chunks. Program state can be kept in variables.","tags":["Message Sequence","Message Channel","Message Endpoint","Message"],"link":"https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageSequence.html","name":"Message Sequence"},{"tagline":"Capture message information in a central location","desc":"Message store captures information about each message in a central location.","helps":"Ballerina can send messages to multiple channels during a single service invocation. Ballerina's concurrency model helps to send messages asynchronously without blocking the main channel. The wildcard binding pattern is used to indicate a 'fire-and-forget' invocation, where the response is not used.","tags":["Message Store","Message Channel","Wire Tap","Message Endpoint","Message"],"link":"https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageStore.html","name":"Message Store"},{"tagline":"Connect messaging systems","desc":"Massaging bridge connects multiple messaging systems by mapping channels and transforming message formats.","helps":"Single Ballerina program can connect to multiple messaging systems. Each system may utilize different protocols and message formats. Protocols such as HTTP, GRPC, Kafka, JDBC, etc. are supported via Ballerina's rich set of stranded libraries. JSON and XML are supported at the type system level. Other formats such as CSV and EDI are supported via libraries.","tags":["Messaging Bridge","Message Channel","Message Endpoint","Channel Adapter","Message"],"link":"https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingBridge.html","name":"Messaging Bridge"},{"tagline":"Process messages with different formats","desc":"Normalizer routes each message type through a custom message translator so that the resulting messages match a common format.","helps":"Ballerina's type test (`is` keyword) and match statement can both be used to test the structure of incoming data. Then the data can be transformed to the required format constructing new data structures. Ballerina's data-oriented design helps with complex transformations with features such as destructuring, query expressions, spread operator, etc.","tags":["Normalizer","Message Channel","Message Endpoint","Message Translator","Message Router","Message"],"link":"https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/Normalizer.html","name":"Normalizer"},{"name":"Scatter-Gather","tagline":"Send messages to multiple recipients and re-aggregate the responses","desc":"Scatter-gather broadcasts a message to multiple recipients and re-aggregates the responses back into a single message.","helps":"Ballerina has a lightweight [concurrency](/learn/by-example/named-workers/) model with built-in syntax support. This helps to send messages parallelly and to wait on aggregation. Query expressions are convenient for transforming, ordering, and filtering the aggregated data.","tags":["Scatter-Gather","Aggregator","Message Channel","Message Endpoint","Message Router","Message"],"link":"https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/BroadcastAggregate.html"},{"tagline":"Publish to a secondary channel for inspection","desc":"Wire tap publishes each incoming message unmodified to a secondary channel for inspection and analysis.","helps":"Ballerina has a lightweight concurrency model with built-in syntax support.
