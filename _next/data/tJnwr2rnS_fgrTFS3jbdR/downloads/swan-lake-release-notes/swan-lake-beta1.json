Therefore, using the `lang.xml:strip()` function on immutable XML values is allowed.\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- An included record parameter of a function can only be specified after any required and/or defaultable parameters of the function.\n- Additive expressions and multiplicative expressions are no longer supported with numeric values when the static types of the operands belong to different numeric basic types.\n- Configurable variables are implicitly `final` now. Moreover, the type of such a variable is now effectively the intersection of the specified type and `readonly`. Therefore, configurable variables no longer support the `final` and `isolated` qualifiers.\n- Type narrowing will no longer take place for captured variables of an anonymous function since the narrowed type cannot be guaranteed during the execution of the function.\n- Type narrowing will now be reset after a compound assignment.\n- Worker message passing after waiting for the same worker has been disallowed.\n- When a named worker is used in a `wait` action, it can no longer be used in a variable reference anywhere else. \n- When the type-descriptor is ambiguous, it is parsed according to the following table in which the precedence is specified in decreasing order.\nFor example, `A & B | C` is considered to be `(A & B) | C`.\n\n  | Operator                  | Associativity |\n  |---------------------------|---------------|\n  | distinct T                |               |\n  | T[ ]                      |               |\n  | T1 & T2                   | left          |\n  | T1 &#124; T2              | left          |\n  | function (args) returns T | right         |\n\n- The Taint analyzer is disabled and the `--taint-check` option is removed. The annotations `@tainted` and `@untainted` were left intact as placeholders for backward compatibility. Any script that used to pass the `--taint-check` option to the `bal run` or `bal build` commands will fail.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake Beta1](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22Ballerina+Swan+Lake+-+Beta1%22+label%3AType%2FBug+label%3ATeam%2FCompilerFE).\n\n## Runtime updates\n\n### Improvements\n\n#### Improved configurable variables to support enum types\n\nValues can be provided for configurable variables of `enum` types via command-line arguments and a TOML file.\n\n\n```ballerina\npublic enum HttpVersion {\n    HTTP_1_1,\n    HTTP_2\n}\n\nconfigurable HttpVersion httpVersion = ?;\n```\n\nThe value for `httpVersion` can be provided via the `Config.toml` file or as a command-line argument as shown below.\n\n```toml\n[configUnionTypes]\nhttpVersion = \"HTTP_1_1\"\n```\n\nThe command-line argument will be as shown below.\n\n```bash\n-ChttpVersion=HTTP_1_1\n```\n\n#### Improved configurable variables to support map types\n\nThe `configurable` feature is improved to support variables of `map` types. Values can be provided via a TOML file.\n\nFor example, if the `map`-typed configurable variables are defined in the following way, \n\n``` ballerina\nconfigurable map<string> admin = ?;\n\ntype HttpResponse record {|\n    string method;\n    string httpVersion = \"HTTP_1_0\";\n    map<string> headers;\n|};\n\nconfigurable HttpResponse response = ?;\nconfigurable map<string>[] users = ?;\n```\n\nthe values can be provided in the `Config.toml` as follows.\n\n```toml\n[admin]\nusername = \"John Doe\"\nmail = \"John@hotmail.com\"\nlocation = \"LK\"\n\n[response]\nmethod = \"POST\"\nhttpVersion = \"HTTP_2_0\"\nheaders.Status = \"200 OK\"\nheaders.Content-Type = \"text/html\"\n\n[[users]]\nusername = \"Jack\"\nlocation = \"UK\"\n\n[[users]]\nusername = \"Jane\"\nlocation = \"US\"\n```\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- The `io.ballerina.runtime.api.types.Type#getName` and `io.ballerina.runtime.api.types.Type#getQualifiedName` methods now return an empty string if no name was associated with the type. The `io.ballerina.runtime.api.types.Type#toString` method can be used to get the string representation of a type.\n- `Wait` actions that wait for expressions that are not named workers can return errors now. The eventual type of such wait future expressions is now `T|error` where `T` is the type of the original return value.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake Beta1](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22Ballerina+Swan+Lake+-+Beta1%22+label%3AType%2FBug+label%3ATeam%2FjBallerina).\n\n## Standard library updates\n\n### New features\n\n#### `graphql` package\n- Added declarative auth configuration\n- Added support for optional types as inputs\n- Added support for returning unions of distinct service objects\n- Added support for inline fragments\n- Added support for enums as input values\n\n### Improvements\n\n#### `cache` package\nMarked the `cache:Cache` class as an `isolated` class.\n\n#### `file` package\nMarked the `file:Listener` class as an `isolated` class.\n\n#### `graphql` package\n- Improved introspection validation and execution\n- Added missing fields in the GraphQL types\n- Improved the compiler plugin to validate inputs and return types\n- Added support to use included record parameters instead of the `record` type in the listener initialization\n\n#### `http` package\n- Improved the `http:Client` remote methods to support inferring the target type from the contextually-expected type\n- Changed the listeners and clients to use include record parameters as configuration parameters\n- Populated the error detail of `http:ClientRequestError` and `http:RemoteServerError` with the response payload and the headers\n- Swapped the `mediaType` and `headers` arguments in the client remote methods\n\n#### `sql` package\n- Added the SQL Array Value type support and introduced the new distinct array value types for identified SQL types\n- Marked the `sql:Client` class as an `isolated` class\n\n#### `websubhub` package\nIncluded the auth configuration in the WebSubHub publisher client configuration.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the [GitHub milestone for Swan Lake Beta1](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Swan+Lake+Beta1%22+label%3AType%2FBug).\n\n## Code to Cloud updates\n\n### New Features\nAdded the `@cloud:Expose` annotation to support custom listeners.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the GitHub milestone for Swan Lake Beta1 of the repositories below.\n\n- [C2C](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerina-c2c/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3AType%2FBug+milestone%3A%22Ballerina+Swan+Lake+-+Beta1%22)\n- [AWS Lambda](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-aws.lambda/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3AType%2FBug+milestone%3A%22Ballerina+Swan+Lake+-+Beta1%22)\n- [Azure Functions](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-azure.functions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3AType%2FBug+milestone%3A%22Ballerina+Swan+Lake+-+Beta1%22) \n\n## Developer tools updates\n\n### Improvements\n\n#### Debugger\n- Added remote debugging support for the command that runs the Ballerina executable JAR\n- Added support for debugging a single Ballerina test in Visual Studio Code\n\n#### Test framework\nIntroduced a flag to pass the expected code coverage report formats\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nTo view bug fixes, see the GitHub milestone for Swan Lake Beta1 of the repositories below.\n\n- [Language Server](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22Ballerina+Swan+Lake+-+Beta1%22+label%3ATeam%2FLanguageServer)\n- [OpenAPI](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-openapi/milestone/5?closed=1) \n- [Test framework](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ATeam%2FTestFramework+milestone%3A%22Ballerina+Swan+Lake+-+Beta1%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3AType%2FBug)\n\n\n","id":"swan-lake-beta1"},"__N_SSG":true}
