To do this, first, execute the command below to get the update tool updated to its latest version. \n                        \n> `ballerina update`\n\n Next, execute the command below to update to Swan Lake Preview 7.\n\n > `ballerina dist pull slp7`                 \n\nHowever, if you are using a Ballerina version below 1.1.0, install via the [installers](https://ballerina.io/downloads/).\n\n##### For new users\n\nIf you have not installed Ballerina, then download the [installers](https://ballerina.io/downloads/) to install.\n\n#### Highlights\n\n- Introducing Ballerina Packages\n- Support for configuring module-level, basic variables at the program execution\n- Ability to mark module-variable declarations with an initial value expression as `isolated`\n- Ability to use the `isolated` qualifier  with an object-constructor expression to construct an `isolated` object\n- Support to mark an object-type definition as a `distinct` object type \n- Allow using the object constructor to create distinct objects\n- Support to register and deregister a dynamic listener at the runtime\n- Introduction of the new runtime APIs\n- Revamp of the `File/Filepath` modules\n- Introduction of new high-level APIs to provide I/O operations\n- Introduction of a new code-action `Add Type Cast`\n- Revamp of the code-action extension APIs \n- Introduction of code to cloud (`c2c`) to simplify deploying Ballerina code in the cloud\n\n### What is new in Ballerina Swan Lake Preview 7\n\n#### Ballerina packages \n\nWith this release we will be introducing Ballerina Packages. Ballerina Package is a bundle that consist of one or more Ballerina modules. Going forward, the Ballerina Package will be used to share Ballerina libraries. \n\n\nWith the introduction of Ballerina packages Ballerina project structure and build tools has also been changed. Please refer to the [Organizing Ballerina Code](/learn/organizing-ballerina-code/) for more details. \n\n\nFor Swan Lake releases Ballerina Central will support users to push and pull Ballerina Packages. Going forward It will not be possible to push individual modules with swan lake releases. With the preview releases you have the ability to push and pull Ballerina Packages to/from Central. However the Packages pushed using preview releases will be cleared when we release the swan lake GA release.You can use the existing Ballerina Central key to push Packages.\n\n\n#### Language\n\n##### Support for configurability\n\nNow, Ballerina supports configuring module-level, basic variables at the program execution. The value provided in the program will be overridden by the value specified in the configuration file. These variables can be initialized using the `configurable` keyword in the following ways. \n\nA `configurable` variable that is defined with `?` as the initializer expression requires a value to be specified for such a variable in the configuration file.\n\n```ballerina\nconfigurable string hostName = ?;\n```\n\nA `configurable` variable that is defined with any other initializer expression can be overridden by a value specified in the configuration file. If a value is not provided in the configuration file, the initializer expression is used.\n\n```ballerina\nconfigurable string hostName = “0.0.0.0”;\n```\n\nCurrently, configuration is supported via a TOML (v0.4.0) file named `configuration.toml`. This file should be located in the current directory. The format of the `configuration.toml` file is as follows.\n\n```toml\n[orgName.pkgName.submoduleName]\n# The above toml table specification is not needed for single file execution\nintVar = 24\nfloatVar = 4.8\nstringVar = \"hello world\"\nbooleanVar = false\n```\n\nCurrently, Ballerina supports configurable variables of the types `int`, `float`, `boolean`, and `string`. Future versions will add support for configurable variables of any type that is a subtype of `readonly&anydata`.\n\n##### Isolated variables\n\nModule variable declarations with an initial value expression can now be marked as `isolated`. An `isolated` variable can be accessed only within a `lock` statement.\n\nSimilar to `isolated` objects, `isolated` variables are also considered as isolated roots, which guarantee that their mutable state is only reachable via the isolated root. As with `isolated` objects, when an `isolated` variable is accessed within a `lock` statement, additional rules apply to how values are transferred in and out of the `lock` statement.\n\nAn `isolated` variable can also be accessed in an `isolated` function.\n\n```ballerina\ntype Coordinates record {|\n    decimal latitude;\n    decimal longitude;\n|};\n\nisolated map<Coordinates> cities = {};\n\nisolated function getLocation(string city) returns Coordinates? {\n    lock {\n        return cities[city].clone();\n    }\n}\n\nisolated function resetCities() {\n    lock {\n        cities = {};\n    }\n}\n```\n\n##### Isolated object constructor expressions\n\nSeveral changes have been introduced to how an object constructor expression can construct an `isolated` object. Now, the `isolated` qualifier can be used with an object constructor expression to construct an `isolated` object.\n\n```ballerina\nclass Identifier {\n    int id = 1;\n}\n\npublic function main() {\n    Identifier nonIsolatedIdentifier = new;\n\n    Identifier isolatedIdentifier = isolated object {\n        final int id = 1;\n        private string name = \"default\";\n\n        function updateName(string name) {\n            lock {\n                self.name = name;\n            }\n        }\n    };\n\n    boolean b1 = <any> nonIsolatedIdentifier is isolated object {}; // false\n    boolean b2 = <any> isolatedIdentifier is isolated object {}; // true\n}\n```\n\nAn object-constructor expression also constructs an `isolated` object if all of the fields of the object constructor expression are `final` and the types of the fields are subtypes of `readonly` or `isolated object {}`.\n\n```ballerina\nisolated class Identifier {\n    final int i;\n    private int j;\n\n    isolated function init(int i, int j) {\n        self.i = i;\n        self.j = j;\n    }\n}\n\npublic function main() {\n    var ob = object { // Constructs an `isolated` object.\n        final int a = 1000;\n        final Identifier b = new (1, 2);\n    };\n\n    isolated object {} isolatedOb = ob; // Now valid.\n}\n```\n\n##### Support for distinct objects\n\n###### Distinct object type\n\nAn object type definition can now define a `distinct` object type.\n\n```ballerina\ntype Circle distinct object {\n    int x;\n    int y;\n    int r;\n};\n\ntype Color [int, int, int];\n\nclass ColoredCircle {\n    *Circle;\n    Color color;\n\n    function init(int x, int y, int r, Color color) {\n        self.x = x;\n        self.y = y;\n        self.r = r;\n        self.color = color;\n    }\n}\n\nclass ColoredCircleLookAlike {\n    int x;\n    int y;\n    int r;\n    Color color;\n\n    function init(int x, int y, int r, Color color) {\n        self.x = x;\n        self.y = y;\n        self.r = r;\n        self.color = color;\n    }\n}\n\nCircle c = new ColoredCircle(0, 0, 0, [123, 100, 100]);\nCircle d = new ColoredCircleLookAlike(0, 0, 0, [123, 100, 100]); // Not allowed.\n```\n\nThe `ColoredCircle` type is a distinct type that is a subtype of the `Circle` distinct object type even though `ColoredCircle` is not marked as a distinct class.\n\nAlthough `ColoredCircleLookAlike` is structurally a subtype of the `Circle` type, since `Circle` is a distinct type and `ColoredCircleLookAlike` does not include it via object type inclusion,`ColoredCircleLookAlike` is not a subtype of `Circle`.\n\n###### Distinct object constructor\n\nIf no type reference is provided in the object constructor, the contextually-expected type must be definite and the type-ids of the constructed object will be the type-ids of the contextually-expected type. This allows using the object constructor to create distinct objects.\n\n#### Runtime\n\n##### Support for `DynamicListener`\n\n A dynamic listener can be registered and deregistered at runtime as follows.\n\n```ballerina\nModListener listenerVar = new(); // Where ModListener is a DynamicListener \nruntime:registerListener(listenerVar);\nruntime:deregisterListener(listenerVar);\n```\n\nThese methods and the definition of `DynamicListener` have been added to the new `lang.runtime` module.\n\n```ballerina\npublic type DynamicListener object {\n    public function __start() returns error?;\n    public function __gracefulStop() returns error?;\n    public function __immediateStop() returns error?;\n};\n```\n\n##### New runtime APIs\n\nThe `io.ballerina.runtime.api.` package will only be exposed to the outside. The runtime API package and its sub packages will contain the required APIs to handle the runtime constructs as follows.\n\n| Package                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| io.ballerina.runtime.api.creators                                   | Provides APIs to create runtime types, values, and errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| io.ballerina.runtime.api.utils                                      | Provides APIs to manage XML, JSON, string, and type-related operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| io.ballerina.runtime.api.types and  io.ballerina.runtime.api.values | Holds the Ballerina runtime API types and values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| io.ballerina.runtime.api.Environment                                | Interop functions can have an `Environment` parameter as the first parameter.

The `BError` class should be used to handle Ballerina runtime errors. The `io.ballerina.runtime.api.creators.ErrorCreator` class provides the required APIs to create runtime errors.                                                                         \n\n#### Standard library\n\n##### Revamp `file` and `filepath` modules\n\nThe `file` and `filepath` APIs have been revamped in this release. A summarized list of the changes done is as follows.\n\n1. The `file` and `filepath` modules have been merged together. There will be no `filepath` module anymore.\n\n2. Some APIs have been removed.\n\n    - From `filepath` - `extension`, `getPathSeparator`, `getPathListSeparator`, `isReserved`, and `matches`\n    - From `file` - `exists`, `tempDir`\n\n3. The implementation of some APIs has been modified.\n\n    - From `filepath` - `normalize`\n    - From `file` - `createDir`, `remove`, `copy`, `readDir`, `getMetaData` (earlier `getFileInfo`)\n\n4. Some new APIs have been introduced.\n\n    - `createTemp` - to create a temporary file in either the default `temp` directory of the OS or in a specific directory.\n    - `createTempDir` - to create a temporary directory as above.\n    - `test` - checks if a file/directory exists, readable, writable, etc.\n\n##### Improved `io` module\n\nThe new high-level APIs below were introduced to provide I/O operations.\n\n1. Added a new set of APIs to read from files supporting different data types.\n    \n    E.g., `io:fileReadBytes`, `io:fileReadJson`, `io:fileReadCsv`, and `io:fileReadXml`\n\n2. Added a new set of APIs to read files as streams.\n    \n    E.g., `io:fileReadBlocksAsStream`, `io:fileReadLinesAsStream`, and `io:fileReadCsvAsStream`\n\n#### Language server\n\n1. Introduced a new code-action `Add Type Cast` to add a typecast when variable assignment fails due to incompatible types.\n\n    **Before execution:**\n    ```ballerina\n    int myInt = 1.1;\n    int myInt = getFloat();\n    ```\n\n    **After execution:**\n    ```ballerina\n    int myInt = <int>1.1;\n    int myInt = <int>getFloat();\n    ```\n\n2. The code-action extension APIs have been revamped in this release. A summarized list of changes is as follows.\n\n    - The `MatchedNode`, `matchedSymbol`, and `matchedExprType` for the cursor position are available now through the `PositionDetails` construct in the `CodeActionContext`.\n    - Listing the priorities can be set for the code-actions now (lower the number, greater the priority).\n\n#### Code to Cloud\n\n1. Introduced code to cloud (c2c) to simplify the experience of developing and deploying Ballerina code in the cloud. Code to cloud builds the containers and required artifacts by deriving the required values from the code without using any annotations.\n\n    ```ballerina\n    import ballerina/http;\n    import ballerina/c2c as _;\n\n    service hello on new http:Listener(9090) {\n        resource function sayHello(http:Caller caller, http:Request req) returns error? {\n            check caller->respond(\"Hello, World!\");\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Removed the Kubernetes module and replaced it by the `c2c` module.\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n1. It is no longer possible to specify the version in an import declaration. A specific version can be imported by specifying the package dependency along with the version in the `Ballerina.toml` file.\n\n    ```toml\n    [[dependency]]\n    org = \"ballerina\"\n    name = \"stringutils\"\n    version = \"0.5.2\"\n    ```\n\n2. As the initial step of upcoming changes for the error detail, the detail type descriptor of an error type descriptor can no longer be a closed record.\n\n3. The Kubernetes module is removed and replaced by the `c2c` module.\n","id":"swan-lake-preview7"},"__N_SSG":true}
