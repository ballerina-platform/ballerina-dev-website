You can edit the `Ballerina.toml` file to change the organization, name, and the version of the package. \n* The `Package.md` is required when you publish a package to a repository. You can edit the content to add a meaningful description about the package.\n* The `hello.bal` file, `resources/` directory `tests/` directory, and the `Module.md` file belong to the default module of the package. \n \nFor more information on these files, see [Package layout](/learn/package-references/#package-layout).\n\nTo generate the Ballerina archive, execute the command below.\n\n```\nbal pack\n```\nYou view the output below.\n\n```\nCompiling source\n\tuser/hello:0.1.0\n\nCreating bala\n\ttarget/bala/user-hello-any-0.1.0.bala\n```\n\n## Publish a library package to Ballerina Central\n\nYou can publish a Ballerina archive to the [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/).\nBefore you publish, ensure the package works as intended because a publish is **permanent**. Once published to Ballerina Central, you cannot overwrite the version or remove the package. However, the number of package versions you can push to Ballerina Central is not restricted.\n\n>**Tip:** As a precaution, use the [local repository](/learn/manage-dependencies/#use-dependencies-from-the-local-repository) first to test out the functionality of the library package before publishing it to Ballerina Central.\n\n\n### Prepare for publishing\n\n1. Create an account on Ballerina Central. To register, [visit the home page](https://central.ballerina.io) and log in via a Google or GitHub account.\n\n2. Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://central.ballerina.io/dashboard?tab=token) and acquire an access token.\n\n3. Download and place the `Settings.toml` file in your home repository (`<USER_HOME>/.ballerina/`). If you already have a `Settings.toml` file configured in your home repository, follow the other option and copy the access token into the `Settings.toml`. \n   If you are connected to the internet via an HTTP proxy, add the following section to `Settings.toml` and change accordingly.\n\n```toml\n[proxy]\nhost = \"localhost\"\nport = \"3128\"\nusername = \"\"\npassword = \"\"\n```\n\n### Define the organization\n\nWhen you push a package to Ballerina Central, the organizations are validated against the value of the `org` field defined in the [Ballerina.toml](/learn/package-references/#the-ballerinatoml-file) file. Therefore, when you have more than one organization in Ballerina Central, pick the organization name that you intend to push the package into, set that as the `org` in the `Ballerina.toml` file inside the package directory, and rebuild the package. If you do not have any organizations created, you can visit the [organizations page](https://central.ballerina.io/dashboard?tab=organizations) to create one.\n\nAlso, organization names starting with `ballerina` (e.g., `ballerina`, `ballerinax`, `ballerinai`, etc.) are reserved for system use, and you cannot publish any packages starting with the `ballerina` prefix to Ballerina Central. Therefore, if you have used a name pattern matching this, update the `Ballerina.toml` and rebuild the package.\n\n### Publish the package\n\nNow, that you are ready to publish, execute the command below to publish the package to Ballerina Central.\n\n```bash\nbal push\n```\n\n## Use the packages in Ballerina Central\n\nAfter publishing your first package, you can create a second package and use the already published package in it.\nAny package published in Ballerina Central is public and can be used in other packages.\n For more information, see [Import a module](/learn/manage-dependencies/#import-a-module).\n","id":"publish-packages-to-ballerina-central","sub":"ballerina-central","third":"","slug":"ballerina-central/publish-packages-to-ballerina-central"},"__N_SSG":true}
