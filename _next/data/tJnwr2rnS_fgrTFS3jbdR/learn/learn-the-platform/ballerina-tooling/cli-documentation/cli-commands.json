It helps you to manage Ballerina packages and modules, test, build, and run programs, etc.\n\nIt also enables you to easily install, update, and switch among Ballerina distributions. \n\nIn the CLI, execute the `bal help` command to view all the actions you can perform with the Ballerina Tool as shown below.\n\n```sh\n→ bal help\nNAME\n       The Ballerina Tool\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       bal [-v | --version]\n       bal help\n       bal <command> [-h | --help]\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Ballerina is a statically-typed, concurrent programming language focusing on network\n       interaction and structured data. It is intended to be the core of a language-centric\n       middleware platform. It not only has all the general-purpose functionality expected\n       from a modern programming language but also has several unusual aspects that make it\n       particularly suitable for its intended purpose.\n\n       Find more information at: https://ballerina.io\n\n\nOPTIONS\n       -v, --version\n           Print the Ballerina version information.\n\n       -h, --help\n           Print the usage details of a command.\n\n\nBALLERINA COMMANDS\n        Below is a list of the available subcommands:\n\n   Core Commands:\n        build           Compile the current package\n        run             Compile and run the current package\n        test            Run package tests\n        doc             Generate current package's documentation\n        pack            Create distribution format of the current package\n\n   Package Commands:\n        new             Create a new Ballerina package\n        init            Create a new Ballerina package in an existing directory\n        add             Add a new Ballerina module to the current package\n        pull            Pull a package from Ballerina Central\n        push            Publish a package to Ballerina Central\n        search          Search Ballerina Central for packages\n\n   Other Commands:\n        clean           Clean the artifacts generated during the build\n        format          Format Ballerina source files\n        grpc            Generate the Ballerina sources for a given Protocol Buffer definition\n        graphql         Generate Ballerina client sources for a given GraphQL schema(SDL) \n                        and GraphQL queries\n        openapi         Generate the Ballerina sources for a given OpenAPI definition and\n                        vice versa\n        asyncapi        Generate Ballerina sources for a given AsyncAPI definition\n        bindgen         Generate the Ballerina bindings for Java APIs\n        shell           Run Ballerina interactive REPL\n        version         Print the Ballerina version\n\n   Update Commands:\n        dist            Manage Ballerina distributions\n        update          Update the Ballerina tool\n\n```\n\nYou can use it in the following format.\n\n> `bal <COMMAND> <ARGUMENTS>`\n\n> **Tip:** You can view details of the commands by executing the `bal help <COMMAND>`. For example, the following is the output of the `bal help pull` command.\n\n```sh\n→ bal help pull\nNAME\n       ballerina-pull - Fetch packages from Ballerina Central\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       bal pull <org-name>/<package-name>[:<version>]\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Download the specified package from Ballerina Central along with its\n       dependencies and cache it in the '.ballerina' directory in the user home.\n\n       Ballerina Central is a package repository hosted at\n       https://central.ballerina.io/. A package repository organizes packages\n       into a three-level hierarchy: organization, package name, and version.\n       Organizations are unique within a repository and can be mapped to an\n       individual user or organization registered with the repository.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Pull the latest version of the 'gmail' connector in the 'wso2' organization\n       from Ballerina Central.\n           $ bal pull wso2/gmail\n\n       Pull the '1.1.0' version of the 'gmail' connector in the 'wso2' organization\n       from Ballerina Central.\n           $ bal pull wso2/gmail:1.1.0\n```\n\n## Core commands\n\nThese everyday commands are your best friends!
