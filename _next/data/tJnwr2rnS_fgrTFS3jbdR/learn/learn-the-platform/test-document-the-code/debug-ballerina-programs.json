The Ballerina compiler comes in handy when detecting syntax and semantic issues. \nHowever, it is very difficult for a compiler to detect runtime errors like logical errors because they occur during the \nprogram execution after a successful compilation. This is where the dedicated debugging tooling support becomes important.\n\nCurrently, we provide a feature-rich debugging experience for troubleshooting Ballerina applications\nvia the [Ballerina Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.Ballerina).\n\n## Start a debug session\n\nThe Ballerina extension provides multiple options to debug Ballerina applications, and the most convenient way will be using the context-aware debug codelens support.\n\nHowever, if you require launching debug sessions with additional configurations (i.e., program arguments, environment variables), you can use `launch.json` configurations\n(For more information, see [Start a debug session with configurations](#start-a-debug-session-with-configurations)).\n\n### Start a program debug session\n\nFollow the steps below to start a quick debug session using CodeLens.\n\n1. Open the folder which includes the Ballerina program you want to debug, and open the source file in the editor.\n\n2. Add the debug points you require by clicking in front of the line numbers of the file you want to debug.\n\n3. Click the `Debug` CodeLens, which will appear just above the `main()` method.\n\n![Start_Main Quick Debug Session](/learn/images/start-quick-main-debug-session.gif)\n\n<br/>\n\n### Start a test debug session\n\nThe Ballerina test functions can also be debugged using the codelens. The `debug` codelens will automatically appear on top of each Ballerina test function, \nand you are able to execute/debug only the selected test case by clicking on the corresponding codelens as shown below.\n\n![Start_Test Quick Debug Session](/learn/images/start-quick-test-debug-session.gif)\n\n<br/>\n\n### Start a debug session with configurations\n\nFollow the steps below to start a debug session with configurations. All the configurations need to be added in the `launch.json` file.\n\n1. Open the folder, which includes the Ballerina program you want to debug, and select the file.\n\n2. Press the **Control + Shift + D** keys (for Mac: **Command + Shift +D**) to launch the Debugger view.\n\n3. Click **create a launch.json** file and then select **Ballerina Debug** as the **Environment**.\n\n    You view the opened `launch.json` file. \n\n4. Add/edit the relevant configurations for debugging in the `launch.json` file.\n\n5. Add the debug points you require by clicking in front of the line numbers of the file you want to debug.\n\n![Start Debug Session](/learn/images/start-debug-session.gif)\n\nThen, you can start a program, test, or remote debug session as shown below.\n\n>**Info:** If you launch the debug session through VS Code, the working directory will be the Ballerina package root. However, you can use remote debugging for alternative working directories.\n\n#### Start a program debug session with configurations\n\nFollow the steps below to start a program debug session.\n\n1. Select **Ballerina Debug** from the drop-down available in the upper left corner to start a program debugging session.\n\n2. Click the **Start Debugging** icon on the upper left corner to start debugging.\n\n    You view the output in the **DEBUG CONSOLE**.\n\n    ![Program Debug](/learn/images/program-debug.gif)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Start a test debug session with configurations\n\nFollow the steps below to start a test debug session.\n\n1. Select **Ballerina Test** from the drop-down available in the upper left corner to start a test debugging session.\n\n2. Click the **Start Debugging** icon on the upper left corner to start debugging.\n\n    You view the output in the **DEBUG CONSOLE**.\n\n    ![Test Debug](/learn/images/test-debug.gif)\n\n<br/>\n\n### Start a remote debug session\n\nFollow the steps below to start a remote debug session.\n\n1. Create the `launch.json` configuration file if it is not created already. For instructions on creating the `launch.json` file, see [Start a debug session with configurations](#start-a-debug-session-with-configurations).\n\n2. Open the `launch.json` file and configure the `debuggeeHost` and `debuggeePort` attributes under the `Ballerina Remote` configurations section accordingly.\n\n3. After setting the remote debug configurations, select **Ballerina Remote** from the drop-down available in the upper left corner to start a remote debugging session.\n\n4. Open the Terminal and execute the Ballerina command, which you want to debug out of the supported remote debugging commands below. \n\n    - Debugging a Ballerina package or a single file: \n\n    ```bash\n    bal run --debug <DEBUGGEE_PORT> <BAL_FILE_PATH/PACKAGE_PATH>\n    ```\n\n   - Debugging Ballerina executable JAR:  \n\n    ```bash \n    bal run --debug <DEBUGGEE_PORT> <EXECUTABLE_JAR_FILE_PATH>\n    ```\n\n    - Debugging Ballerina tests: \n\n    ```bash\n    bal test --debug <DEBUGGEE_PORT> <PACKAGE_PATH>\n    ```\n    \n    The terminal will show the following log:\n\n    ```bash\n    Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005\n    ```\n\n5. Click the **Start Debugging** icon on the upper left corner to start debugging.\n\n    You view the output in the **DEBUG CONSOLE**.\n\n    ![Remote Debug](/learn/images/remote-debug.gif)\n\n<br/>\n\n## Use debug configurations\n\nThe Ballerina debugger supports various debug configuration options via the `launch.json` file. \n\n>**Info:** You can either add configurations to the existing `launch.json` file (which is located in your workspace root under the `.vscode` directory), or you can generate the `launch.json` configurations file with default values by,\n\n1. Click the **Run and Debug** icon in the left menu or press the **Control + Shift + D** keys to launch the Debugger view (for Mac - **Command + Shift +D**).\n\n2. Click on **create a launch.json file** and then select **Ballerina Debug**.\n\n![Run And Debug](/learn/images/run-and-debug.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n![Ballerina Debug](/learn/images/ballerina-debug.png)\n\n<br/>\n\nHere are the default configurations generated for the Ballerina debugging:\n\n![Debug Configurations](/learn/images/debug-configurations.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n### Ballerina `launch.json` attributes\n\nThe auto-generated `launch.json` file consists of three main configurations named `Ballerina Debug`, `Ballerina Test` and `Ballerina Remote` \n\nEach configuration supports a different set of attributes, which will be provided via IntelliSense completion suggestions.\n\nThe following attributes are mandatory for all configurations.\n\n- `name` - The reader-friendly name to appear in the Debug launch configuration dropdown.\n- `type` - The type of debugger to use for this launch configuration. The attribute value must be kept as `ballerina` for all Ballerina debugging configuration types.\n- `request` - The request type of this launch configuration. Currently, launch and attach are supported.\n\nThe following attributes are supported for all Ballerina `launch` configurations.\n\n- `programArgs` - Any program arguments that are required to be passed into the `main` function of the Ballerina program to be launched can be passed as a list of strings.\n- `commandOptions` - If required, you can configure command options for the Ballerina program to be launched as a list of strings. You can see the list of all the available command options by executing the following CLI commands in your terminal.\n    - For the `Ballerina Debug` configuration:\n\n    ```bash\n    bal run --help\n    ```\n\n    - For the `Ballerina Test` configuration:\n\n    ```bash\n    bal test --help\n    ```\n\n- `env` - Any environment variables you need to configure for launching the Ballerina program can be passed as a map of strings (name and value).\n- `debugTests` - Indicates whether to debug the tests for the given script.\n\nThe following attributes are supported for all Ballerina `attach` configurations.\n\n- `debuggeeHost` - Host address of the remote process to be attached (if not specified, the default value will be the localhost(`127.0.0.1`)).\n- `debuggeePort` - Port number of the remote process to be attached.\n\n## Use the debugging features\n\nThe following debugging features are currently supported by the Ballerina VScode extension.\n\n- Launch/Attach\n- Breakpoints\n  - Conditional Breakpoints\n  - Logpoints\n- Pause & Continue\n- Step In/Out/Over\n- Ballerina Strand and Stacktrace view\n- Variable view\n- Variable/Expression Watch Window\n- Expression Evaluation\n\n### Conditional breakpoints\n\nThe Ballerina debugger provides the ability of setting Ballerina expression-based conditions for regular breakpoints. \nThe debugger will suspend at the breakpoint whenever the expression evaluates to true.\n\n![Debugger Conditional Breakpoints](/learn/images/debugger-conditional-breakpoints.gif)                \n\n<br/>\n\n### Logpoints        \n\nLogpoints are another variant of breakpoints, which do not \"break\" the program execution but instead log a message to the console. Logpoints are especially useful for injecting logging while debugging production servers that cannot be paused or stopped.\n\nLogpoints can also be enabled/disabled and can be controlled by conditions similar to regular breakpoints.\n\n![Debugger Logpoints](/learn/images/debugger-logpoints.gif)\n\nLog messages can either be plain texts or string templates, which can contain expressions to be evaluated within the `${}` syntax.\n\n![Debugger String Temaplate Logpoints](/learn/images/debugger-logpoints-template.gif)\n\n<br/>\n\n### Pause and continue\n\nAny running Ballerina programs can be suspended immediately at the current execution line of the program, using the `pause` command in VSCode as shown below. \nWith this feature, you are able to suspend (and resume) the remote VM resulting in a debug hit at the current execution line of the program. \n\n![Debugger Pause/Resume Commands](/learn/images/debugger-pause-resume-commands.gif)\n\nThis feature will be useful in contexts where the program seems to be hanged due to blocking operations/infinite loops, and when you want to know the exact line that the program is waiting on.\n\n### Expression evaluation\n\nBallerina expression evaluator allows evaluating Ballerina variables and expressions at runtime allowing them to be viewed when the IDE is in the break mode.\n\nThe Ballerina VSCode debugger lets you evaluate expressions in the ways below.\n\n#### Use the debug console\n\n![Debugger Evaluation Console](/learn/images/debugger-evaluation-console.gif)\n\n#### Use the watch window\n\n![Debugger Watch Window](/learn/images/debugger-watch-window.gif)\n\n<br/>\n\n>**Info:** For more information on VSCode debugging features, go to [VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).\n\n","id":"debug-ballerina-programs","sub":"test-document-the-code","third":"","slug":"test-document-the-code/debug-ballerina-programs"},"__N_SSG":true}
