All tests within a moduleâ€™s `tests` subdirectory \nare considered to be part of the same test suite. The test source files could have any name. The test functions are just \nBallerina functions, which use a special annotation to mark the function as a test. Test functions must be specified \nwith the `@test:Config{}` annotation and there is no restriction on the test function name.\n\nThe functions, services, and global variables defined in a module are accessible from within the test files.\nHence, you cannot redefine a symbol in the test files if it is already declared in the module.\nOn the other hand, symbols defined in the test files will not be visible inside the module source files.\n\n## Test resources\nThe `resources` subdirectory found within the `tests` directory is meant to contain any files or resources that are \nexclusively required for testing. You can access the resource files either using the absolute path or using the path \nrelative to the package root.\n\n## Test configurations\nConfigurations for testing can be provided using configurable variables. The values for configurable variables can be \nprovided in a file named `Config.toml` located in the `tests` directory.\n\nFor information on using configurable variables, see\n[Configurable variables](/learn/configure-ballerina-programs/quick-start-on-configurable-variables).\n","id":"structure-tests","sub":"test-document-the-code","third":"test-ballerina-code","slug":"test-document-the-code/test-ballerina-code/structure-tests"},"__N_SSG":true}
