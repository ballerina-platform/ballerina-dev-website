This option will provide two choices to you, either to delete only the particular service or the entire Ballerina package.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/visual-programming/architecture-view/architecture-diagram/delete-component.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n\n## Link to an internal API\n\nYou can create links between your project components using the **Use Internal API** option in the node menu. That will introduce a service-level client in your source service, which you can configure and use.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/visual-programming/architecture-view/architecture-diagram/internal-linking.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n\n## Link to an external API\n\nYou can invoke an external endpoint using the **Use External API** option in the node menu. That will prompt you to a connector marketplace from which you can choose the required external endpoint.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/visual-programming/architecture-view/architecture-diagram/external-linking.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n\n## Delete links\n\nBy hovering over a link, you can choose to remove the particular interaction in your diagram. That will result in the deletion of the client that was used to interact between the services.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/visual-programming/architecture-view/architecture-diagram/delete-links.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n\n## Edit diagram labels\n\nYou can edit the display names of your project components using the **Edit Label** option in the node menu. That will update the **label** value of the particular componentâ€™s display annotation.\n\n<img src=\"/learn/images/vs-code-extension/visual-programming/architecture-view/architecture-diagram/edit-label.gif\" class=\"cInlineImage-full\"/>\n","id":"design-using-the-architecture-view","sub":"","third":"","slug":"design-using-the-architecture-view","codes":"[]"},"__N_SSG":true}
