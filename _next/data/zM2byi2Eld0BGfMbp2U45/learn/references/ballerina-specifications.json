Currently, there is only one implementation (i.e., jBallerina that compiles Ballerina to Java bytecodes). Others will follow including a compiler, which generates native binaries using LLVM.\n\nBallerina has a collection of specifications starting with the Ballerina Language Specification. Other specifications (which are yet to be moved to the specification repository or, in some cases, yet to be written) will cover the Ballerina library, built-in language extensions such as security, immutability & deprecation, module and project management, testing, documentation, compiler extensions for cloud, and Ballerina Central.\n\n## Language specifications \n\nFrom the start of 2019, Ballerina  specifications are versioned chronologically using the convention `20XYRn`, where `XY` is the 2-digit year (e.g., 19), `R` stands for \"Release\" and `n` is the release number for that year. Prior to 2019, a semver versioning scheme was used. However, that approach was abandoned when the language specification reached 0.980.\n\n### Released specifications\n\nBelow are the most stable versions of the language specification, which are in sync with the Ballerina releases.\n\n> **Note:** The changes since previous releases section of the specification identifies the changes that have occurred in each version of the specification.\n\n| Version | Release Date | Description |\n| ------- | ------------ | ----------- |\n| <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/spec/lang/2024R1/\">2024R1</a> | 2024-07-18 | First release of 2024.
