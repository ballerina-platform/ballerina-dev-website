<p>The primary objective of Ballerina Central is to manage the wide spectrum of Ballerina packages most effectively and optimally. Therefore, it was critical for Ballerina Central to be a cloud deployment, which can scale the platform on demand when the load is increased by preserving consistent high availability for its users.
