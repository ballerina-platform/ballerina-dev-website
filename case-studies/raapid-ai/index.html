<p>RAAPID.AI&#x27;s innovative integration solution revolves around creating dedicated projects within <a href="https://wso2.com/choreo/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WSO2 Choreo</a> for each healthcare provider. This modular approach involves configuring components to pull data from Electronic Health Records (EHR) via various protocols like FHIR, HL7, or CCDA. Ballerina&#x27;s data transformation capabilities are harnessed to convert the retrieved medical data into FHIR format before pushing it back to RAAPID.AI&#x27;s platform through FHIR/REST APIs. Additionally, another component facilitates the pulling and transformation of summarized data, ensuring seamless data flow between the healthcare providers and RAAPID.AI platform.</p>

<p>The key components of the solution are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Project creation:</strong> RAAPID.AI administrators create a dedicated project for each healthcare provider within WSO2 Choreo, intending to connect and sync data with the RAAPID.AI platform. Each project contains a set of components designed to fulfill specific functionalities needed for data synchronization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data pulling:</strong> A component is configured to trigger data pulling from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) of the provider. The data is retrieved using a configured protocol (FHIR/HL7/CCDA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data transformation:</strong> The retrieved medical data is transformed into the FHIR format using Ballerina&#x27;s powerful data manipulation capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data pushing:</strong> The transformed data is then pushed back to the FHIR/REST APIs of the RAAPID.AI platform, ensuring the data is available in a standardized format for further processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data summarization and pushing:</strong> Another component is set up to trigger the pulling of processed summary data. This data is transformed into the source system format using Ballerina and then pushed back to the provider&#x27;s system.</p>
</li>
