# The Ballerina Community

The Ballerina community has been bootstrapped by <a href="https://wso2.com">WSO2</a> via sponsorship of the design & implementation of the Ballerina platform. Ballerina is a fully open source project with all source code licensed under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</a> and the specifications licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0">Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International</a> license.

We warmly welcome any and all contributors to the community to help establish Ballerina as a truly community owned resource!
