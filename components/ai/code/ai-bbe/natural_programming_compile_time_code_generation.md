title: "Natural Programming: Compile-time Code Generation"
description: "Bring natural language into your compilation process and generate code based on a prompt at compile-time. Just like having a Copilot baked into your build process.


- **Compile-time data generation** – Use `const natural` expressions to generate structured, realistic, and type-safe data during compilation. Ideal for generating meaningful test data.


- **Compile-time function generation** – Annotate external function bodies with `@natural:code` and let the compiler generate the implementations based on natural language prompts.
