title: "Natural Programming: Compile Time Code Generation"
description: "Bring natural language into your compile process and generate code intelligently at compile-time.


- **Compile-time data generation** – Use `const natural` expressions to generate structured, realistic and type-safe data during compilation. Ideal for generating rich and meaningful test data.


- **AI-synthesized function bodies** – Annotate functions with `@natural:code` and let the compiler generate their implementations from natural language prompts — just like having a Copilot baked into your build process."
