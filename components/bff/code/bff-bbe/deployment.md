title: 'Develop flexible and scalable backends'
description: App backends are often required to handle high loads, which can fluctuate rapidly. Therefore, the ability to scale systems up or down based on the current load is crucial. Ballerina-based backends can aggregated or segregated features into individual components, which can be deployed and sclaed independently. These components can then be deployed on Kubernetes or similar infrastructure to provision flexible and scalable backends.<br><br>In addition, Ballerina backends can be instantly taken to production by deploying in Choreo, a comprehensive app development platform with pre-built CI/CD pipelines, multi-environment support, and robust monitoring for Ballerina apps.
