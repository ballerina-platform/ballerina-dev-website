title: 'Connect to EMRs, EHRs, data sources and more'
description: Ballerina has 100s of connectors to well-known Health Systems such as Epic, Cerner, athenahealth, and non-health systems such as Salesforce, and can connect to any backend that has a FHIR, HL7, or Open API interface. Go below the hood and connect directly to a database as well if that is the only way to fetch data.
