title: 'Why is Ballerina the way to write healthcare applications?'
description: 'Java and HAPI have long been the de facto for health app development. However, cloud native healthcare application development goes beyond dealing with objects and frameworks. This domain needs a fresh architecture and technology that treats concepts like FHIR and HL7 as first class citizens in the language, alongside concepts like JSON and APIs.<br/><br/>

Ballerina is a language built from ground up for building healthcare applications, quickly, easily and securely. Alongside its powerful integration capabilities, Ballerina natively understands health data standards like FHIR and HL7. It includes FHIR connectors and validators, FHIR API templates, HL7/C-CDA to FHIR data transformations, Capability Statement template, SMART configuration template, EMR connectors, and supports any Implementation Guide with its automatic code and template generation capabilities.'
