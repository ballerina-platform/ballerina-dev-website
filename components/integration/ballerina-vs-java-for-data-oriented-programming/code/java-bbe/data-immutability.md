title: 'Data immutability'
description: Immutable data ensures data integrity, simplifies reasoning about code, and reduces the potential for unexpected side effects. <br><br>Ballerina and Java approach data immutability differently. In Ballerina, immutability is emphasized by default, providing deep immutability for data. On the other hand, in Java, a `record` is considered to be shallowly immutable.
