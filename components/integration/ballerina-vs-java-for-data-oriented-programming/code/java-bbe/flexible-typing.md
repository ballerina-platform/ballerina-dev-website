title: 'Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept'
description: 'Ballerina employs "be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept" by using structural types that support openness. <br><br>These types serve a dual purpose: enhancing static typing within programs and describing service interfaces accurately. While outgoing messages are tightly controlled to ensure protocol adherence, incoming data is handled with a degree of flexibility. The result is a balance of strictness and tolerance that enhances interoperability and resilience. This makes Ballerina a robust and adaptable choice for constructing cloud-native applications.'
