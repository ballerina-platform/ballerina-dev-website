title: 'Model data as data'
description: Data-oriented programming encourages us to represent data in its pure form. Ballerina and Java provide records, a language construct that simplifies this pure data representation. While Java has recently enhanced its capabilities to support this approach, Ballerina has been fundamentally architected to facilitate data-oriented programming from its inception.
