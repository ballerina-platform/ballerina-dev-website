title: 'Data validation at the boundary'
description: Boundary data validation is crucial for data-oriented programming. It ensures only valid and reliable data enters the system, improving data integrity, downstream processing, and security. <br><br>Ballerina, with its built-in language features, handles data validation automatically. In Java, libraries like Hibernate Validator and Apache Commons Validator provide tools for enforcing validation rules.
