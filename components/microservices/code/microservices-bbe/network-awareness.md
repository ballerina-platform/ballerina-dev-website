description: Microservices communicate extensively over networks, making integration a crucial aspect of their design. Ballerina shines in this area with its built-in network awareness. It seamlessly integrates with various protocols (HTTP, gRPC, and more) and data formats (JSON, XML) commonly used in microservices architectures.
