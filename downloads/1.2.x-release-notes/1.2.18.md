### Overview of jBallerina 1.2.18
The jBallerina 1.2.18 patch release improves upon the 1.2.17 release by introducing the features listed below and addressing an [issue](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues/1751).

You can use the update tool to update to jBallerina 1.2.18 as follows.

**For existing users:**
If you are already using jBallerina version 1.2.0, or above, you can directly update your distribution to jBallerina 1.2.18 by executing the following command:

However, if you are using

- a jBallerina version below 1.1.0, install via the [installers](https://ballerina.io/downloads/)
