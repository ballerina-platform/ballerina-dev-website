## Overview of jBallerina 1.2.55

The jBallerina 1.2.55 patch release improves upon the 1.2.54 release by adding security fixes and support for Java 11 in Docker.

You can use the update tool to update to jBallerina 1.2.55 as follows.

**For existing users:**

If you are already using jBallerina version 1.2.14, or above, you can directly update your distribution to jBallerina 1.2.55 by executing the following command:

```
bal dist update
```

However, if you are using

- jBallerina 1.2.0 to 1.2.13, run `ballerina dist update` to update
- jBallerina 1.2.0 but being switched to a previous version, run `ballerina dist pull jballerina-1.2.55` to update
- a jBallerina version below 1.1.0, install via the [installers](https://ballerina.io/downloads/)

**For new users:**

If you have not installed jBallerina, then download the [installers](https://ballerina.io/downloads/) to install.
