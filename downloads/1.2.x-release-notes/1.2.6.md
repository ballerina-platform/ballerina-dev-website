You can use the update tool to update to jBallerina 1.2.6 as follows.

**For existing users:**

If you are already using jBallerina version 1.2.0, or above, you can directly update your distribution to jBallerina 1.2.6 by executing the following command:

> $ ballerina dist update

However, you need to use the following commands instead of the above if you have installed:

- jBallerina 1.2.0 but switched to a previous version: `ballerina dist pull 1.2.6`
- a jBallerina version below 1.1.0: install via the [installers](https://ballerina.io/downloads/)

**For new users:**

If you have not installed jBallerina, then download the [installers](https://ballerina.io/downloads/) to install.
