## Developer tools updates

### New features

#### Language Server

#### CLI

#### OpenAPI tool
- Introduced the `flatten` sub-command, which flattens the OpenAPI contract file by moving all the inline schemas to the components section. The output is a modified OpenAPI contract.

  ```
  $ bal openapi flatten <openapi.yaml>
  ```
- Introduced the `sanitize` sub-command, which sanitizes the OpenAPI contract file according to Ballerina's best naming practices. The Ballerina name extensions are added to the schemas which can not be modified directly. The output is a modified OpenAPI contract.

  ```
  $ bal openpai sanitize <openapi.yaml>
  ```
- Add code generation support with the new Ballerina name extensions. These extensions are mapped as relevant 
annotations in the generated types, parameters and record fields.
  For example,
  ```yaml
  ...
  paths:
    /albums:
      get:
        tags:
          - albums
        operationId: getAlbums
        parameters:
          - name: _artists_
            in: query
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                type: string
              default: []
            x-ballerina-name: artists  --->// Ballerina name extension
        responses:
          "200":
            description: Ok
            content:
              application/json:
                schema:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: "#/components/schemas/Album"
  ```
  Generated Ballerina service type code,
  ```ballerina
  ...
  resource function get albums(@http:Query {name: "_artists_"} string[] artists = []) returns Album[];
  ...
  ```
  This code generation support is available for client, service implementation, and service type code generation.


- Added support for relaxed data binding on the client side payload. This enables, `nil` values are treated as optional, and absent fields are handled as `nilable` types.
