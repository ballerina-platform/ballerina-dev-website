## Ballerina library updates

### New features

#### `http` package

- Added relaxed binding support for service and client data binding. This provides the flexibility to bind nil values to optional fields and absent values to nilable fields.

  ```ballerina
  // Enable relaxed data binding on the client side.
  http:Client httpClient = check new("http://localhost:9090", laxDataBinding = true);
  
  // Enable relaxed data binding on the server side.
  @http:ServiceConfig {laxDataBinding: true}
  service /api on new http:Listener(9090) {
  }
  ```

### Improvements

#### `http` package

- Added `anydata` support for `setPayload` methods in the request and response objects.
- Improved the `@http:Query` annotation to overwrite query parameter names in clients.
- Improved the `@http:Query` annotation to overwrite query parameter names in services.
- Added header name mapping support in record fields.
- Migrated client and service data binding to use the `toJson` and `parserAsType` functions from the  `ballerina/data.jsondata` module instead of the `fromJsonWithType` function from the `ballerina.lang.value` module. This change improves how JSON data is converted to Ballerina records and vice versa, by allowing field names to be overridden using the `jsondata:Name` annotation.
- Added support to configure the server name to be used in the SSL SNI extension.

## Developer tools updates

### New features

#### Language Server

#### CLI

#### OpenAPI tool
- Introduced the `flatten` sub-command, which flattens the OpenAPI contract file by moving all the inline schemas to the components section. The output is a modified OpenAPI contract.

  ```
  $ bal openapi flatten <openapi.yaml>
  ```
- Introduced the `sanitize` sub-command, which sanitizes the OpenAPI contract file according to Ballerina's best naming practices. The Ballerina name extensions are added to the schemas which can not be modified directly. The output is a modified OpenAPI contract.

  ```
  $ bal openpai sanitize <openapi.yaml>
  ```
- Add code generation support with the new Ballerina name extensions. These extensions are mapped as relevant annotations in the generated types, parameters and record fields.

  For example,
  ```yaml
  ...
  paths:
    /albums:
      get:
        tags:
          - albums
        operationId: getAlbums
        parameters:
          - name: _artists_
            in: query
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                type: string
              default: []
            x-ballerina-name: artists  --->// Ballerina name extension
        responses:
          "200":
            description: Ok
            content:
              application/json:
                schema:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: "#/components/schemas/Album"
  ```
  Generated Ballerina service type code,
  ```ballerina
  ...
  resource function get albums(@http:Query {name: "_artists_"} string[] artists = []) returns Album[];
  ...
  ```
  This code generation support is available for client, service implementation, and service type code generation.


- Added support for relaxed data binding on the client side payload. This enables, `nil` values are treated as optional, and absent fields are handled as `nilable` types.

## Ballerina packages updates

### New features

### Improvements

- Replaced `Package.md`, and `Module.md` with `README.md` as the primary documentation for packages, ensuring a unified documentation format across Ballerina Central and version control platforms. 

  If you create a new package with the library template, a `README.md` is created.

  ```
  $ bal build -t lib winery

  .
  ├── winery.bal
  ├── Ballerina.toml
  ├── README.md
  └── tests/
        └── lib_test.bal
  ```

- Introduced the capability to overrride the default `README.md` by specifying a preferred file using the `readme` field in the `[package]` table of the `Ballerina.toml`.

  ``` toml
  [package]
  org = "samjs"
  name = "winery"
  version = "0.1.0"
  readme = "docs/Reference.md"
  ```

- Introduced configuration support to specify metadata, including enabling export and defining a custom readme file name for a specific module.
  
  The following example demonstrates configuring the foo module in `Ballerina.toml`.

  ``` toml
  [[package.modules]]
  name = "winery.foo"
  export = true
  readme = "README.md"
   ```
  
- Upgraded the version of BALA archives to `3.0.0` to accommodate the above changes.
