## Overview of Ballerina Swan Lake Update 9 (2201.9.0)

<em> Swan Lake Update 9 (2201.9.0) is the ninth update release of Ballerina Swan Lake, and it includes a new set of features and significant improvements to the compiler, runtime, Ballerina library, and developer tooling. It is based on the 2023R1 version of the Language Specification.</em>

## Update Ballerina

Update your current Ballerina installation directly to 2201.9.0 using the [Ballerina Update Tool](/learn/update-tool/) as follows.

1. Run `bal update` to get the latest version of the Update Tool.
2. Run `bal dist update` to update to this latest distribution.

## Install Ballerina

If you have not installed Ballerina, download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.

## Language updates

### New features

### Improvements

#### Remove dependence on syntactic location for module-level XMLNS declarations

It is now possible for expressions to refer to module-level XML namespaces declarations that are declared later in the code.

```ballerina
public function main() {
    string exdoc = ex:doc;
}

xmlns "http://example.com" as ex;
```
#### Allow declaration of XML namespaces with the same prefix in multiple Ballerina files

It is now possible to declare XML namespaces with the same prefix in multiple Ballerina files (source parts) of the same package. This is because the prefix symbol space applies to the source part, and not the module.

main.bal
```ballerina
xmlns "https://ballerina.io/" as ns;
```

utils.bal
 ```ballerina
// Previously resulted in a compile time error `redeclared symbol 'ns'` now works as expeted.
xmlns "https://example.com/" as ns; 
```

## Developer tools updates

### New features

#### Formatter

##### Customize formatting

It is now possible to provide custom formatting configurations to the Ballerina formatter via a local or remote configuration file. This allows for consistency in code style across projects in an organization and simplifies the process of enforcing formatting standards. This is introduced as an experimental feature in Ballerina 2201.9.0.

#### Language Server

#### CLI

#### OpenAPI tool

- OpenAPI client generation has been integrated to the `bal build` command. The user can provide the OpenAPI tool configuration in the Ballerina.toml file and generate the client during a build.

  For example:
  ```ballerina
  [[tool.openapi]]
  id = "dbclient"
  filePath = "openapi.yaml"
  targetModule = "delivery"
  ```
  
- Introduced the `add` sub-command to the OpenAPI tool to update the Ballerina.toml file with the OpenAPI tool configuration details. 
  
   For example:

  `bal openapi add -i <yaml file> --mode client --id <tool config id>`


- Added support for OpenAPI mapping for Ballerina constraints in OpenAPI specification generation.
- Added support for OpenAPI link field mapping for Ballerina HATEOAS feature in OpenAPI specification generation.
- Added support for OpenAPI mapping for Ballerina HTTP interceptor services in OpenAPI specification generation.
- Added support for OpenAPI response mapping for Ballerina HTTP status code errors in OpenAPI specification generation.
- Added support for Ballerina client generation with status code response binding. This can be enabled by providing the `--with-status-code-binding` option to the OpenAPI client generation command.
  
  For example:

  `bal openapi -i <yaml file> --mode client --with-status-code-binding`


### Improvements

#### OpenAPI Tool
- Added support for the Ballerina record rest field mapping in OpenAPI specification generation.
- Improved the OpenAPI client generation with parameterized path segments in the OpenAPI specification by generating `remote` methods in the Ballerina client.

#### Formatter

##### Multiline function call formatting.

When a multiline function call is present in the code, the subsequent lines used to have the same indentation as the first line. This behavior is modified to have an indentation of 8 spaces in the subsequent lines.

Before formatting

```ballerina
addNumbers(numberOne,  numberTwo, numberThree,
numberFour, numberFive, numberSix);
```

After formatting

```ballerina
addNumbers(numberOne, numberTwo, numberThree,
        numberFour, numberFive, numberSix);
```

When a multiline object is present as an argument, the indentation of the subsequent lines is set such that those lines have the same indentation as the object declaration.

```ballerina
public function updateValues(int t1, int t2) {
    update(t1, object {
                   int i = 1;
                   int y = 2;
               },
               t2);
}
```

## Ballerina packages updates

### New features

### Improvements

#### `cloud` package
- Directories can now be mounted as ConfigMaps and Secrets.

### Bug fixes

## Backward-incompatible changes

### Language

- A bug which resulted in the addition of a default namespace to an XML navigation name pattern, even when the default namespace is defined after it, has been fixed.

    ```ballerina
    public function main() {
        xml x = xml `<item><name>Box</name></item>`;

        // Previously evaluated to an empty XML sequence, now evaluates to 
        // `<item><name>Box</name></item>`
        xml x1 = x.<item>;

        xmlns "http://example.com/";
    }
    ```

- A bug which resulted in XML navigation failing to return elements with namespaces different from the default one when using `<*>` to access XML element children has been fixed.

    ```ballerina
    public function main() {
        xmlns "http://example.com/";
        xmlns "https://ballerina.io/" as ns0;

        xml x1 = xml `
        <item>
            <ns0:name>ball</ns0:name>
            <type>t</type>
        </item>`;

        // Previously evaluated to `
        // <type xmlns="http://example.com/">t</type>`,
        // now evaluates to, 
        // `<ns0:name xmlns="http://example.com/" xmlns:ns0="https://ballerina.io">ball</ns0:name>
        // <type xmlns="http://example.com/">t</type>`
        xml x2 = x1/<*>;
    }
    ```

- A bug which resulted in the XML namespace URI being empty when a constant is used in the XML namespace declaration has been fixed.

    ```ballerina
    const URI = "http://ballerina.com/";
    xmlns URI as ns0;

    public function main() {
        // Previously evaluated to "{}attr", now evaluates to {http://ballerina.com/}attr
        string s = ns0:attr;
    }
    ```

- A bug which resulted in a compiler crash or a nil value for a variable of a binding pattern which is used as a captured variable has been fixed.

    ```ballerina
    type Doctor record {
        string name;
        string category;    
    };

    function updateDoctorCategories(Doctor doctor, string[] categories) returns error? {
        var {category} = doctor;
        string cat = category;
         // Previously evaluated to `true` since category is used in a closure, now returns `false`.
        boolean b = <any> category is ();
        if !categories.some(existingCategory => existingCategory == category) {
            categories.push(category);
        }
    }
    ```

- A bug which resulted in XML navigation evaluating to empty XML sequence when the navigation name pattern contains escape characters has been fixed.

    ```ballerina
    public function main() {
        xml d = xml `
        <person>
            <name>John</name>
            <home-address>some address</home-address>
        </person>`;

        xml x1 = d/<home\-address>; // Previously evaluated to an empty XML sequence, now evaluates to `<home-address>some address</home-address>`
    }
    ```

-  A bug which resulted in no compilation errors being logged for missing required fields in the `select` clause has been fixed.

    ```ballerina
    type Student record {|
        int id;
        string name;
        Enrollment[] enrollments;
    |};

    type Course record {|
        int id;
        string name;
    |};

    type Enrollment record {|
        int id;
        string name;
        int year;
        int grade;
    |};

    function getStudentCourses(Student student) returns int|Course[] {
        int|Course[] courses = from var enrollment in student.enrollments
                            select {
                                // Compile-time error now, since the `name` field is not specified
                                id: enrollment.id
                            };
        return courses;
    }
    ```

- A bug which resulted in the top-most comments above imports being moved when formatting imports has been fixed. This fix also preserves new lines within comment blocks above imports.

    function attachAgent() {

    }

### `rabbitmq` package

- Removed the previously deprecated `rabbitmq:Message` record. Consequently, corresponding APIs no longer accommodate this record. Users are advised to transition to utilizing subtypes of `rabbitmq:AnydataMessage` for continued functionality.

### `nats` package

- Removed the previously deprecated `nats:Message` record. Consequently, corresponding APIs no longer accommodate this record. Users are advised to transition to utilizing subtypes of `nats:AnydataMessage` for continued functionality.

### `cloud` package

- SSL configurations are no longer automatically retrieved from the code. You need to explicitly mark them as secrets in `Cloud.toml`. 
    ```toml
    [[cloud.secret.files]]
    file="resource."
    mount_dir="./resource"
    ```

- The `mount_path` of `[[cloud.secret.files]]` and  `[[cloud.config.maps]]` is renamed as `mount_dir` in the `Cloud.toml` file, and now it always expects the destination directory.

- Entrypoints are used instead of CMD to run the ballerina application in the Dockerfile.
    ```
    CMD ["java","..."] //Old
    ```

    ```
    ENTRYPOINT ["java","..."] //New
    ```

- Suffix is added to generated ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes to avoid Conflicts.
- Subpaths are used in Kubernetes to better support multiple files in the same directory.
