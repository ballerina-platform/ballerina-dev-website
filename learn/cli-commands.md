# CLI Commands

The “ballerina” command is your one-stop-shop for all the things you do in Ballerina. You can use it in the below format.

`ballerina <THE-COMMAND> <ITS-ARGUEMENTS>`

The below are all the actions you can perform with it:

- [Get started](#get-started)
- [Build, test, and run programs](#build-test-and-run-programs)
- [Work with Ballerina Central](#work-with-ballerina-central)
- [Manage projects](#manage-projects)
- [Use the supporting tools](#use-the-supporting-tools)
