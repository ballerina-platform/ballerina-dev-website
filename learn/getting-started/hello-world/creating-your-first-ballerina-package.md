The below are the basic steps you need to know about writing a Ballerina package. It also introduces the package-related commands in the Ballerina command-line tool.

## Creating the Package

To create a new Ballerina package, use the `bal new` command below.

```bash
bal new hello_world
```

This will create a new Ballerina package with a main function. If you are creating a service instead of a main function, pass the `-t service` option.

The `bal new` command generates the below.

```bash
cd hello_world
tree .
.
├── Ballerina.toml
└── main.bal
    
0 directories, 2 files
```

The sections below walk you through each of these files.

**`Ballerina.toml`**

The [`Ballerina.toml`](/learn/user-guide/ballerina-packages/package-layout#ballerinatoml) file identifies a directory as a Ballerina package.

**`.gitignore`**

The `bal new` command also generates the `.gitignore` file by default with `target` added as an entry.

**`main.bal`**

This file generated by the `bal new` command will contain code for a `hello world` application as shown below.

```bal
import ballerina/io;  

public function main() { 
    io:println("Hello World!"); 
}

```

## Building the Package

Build the package and generate an executable JAR file as follows.

```bash
bal build
Compiling source
 	examples/hello_world:0.1.0 

Generating executable
    target/bin/hello_world.jar
```

## Running the Package

Then, run it as follows.

```bash
bal run target/bin/hello_world.jar
Hello World!
```

>**Info:** You can also use `bal run` to compile and then run it in a single step as follows.

```bash
bal run
Compiling source
    examples/hello_world:0.1.0

Running executable

Hello World!
```
