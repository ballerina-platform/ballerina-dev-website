## Setting up the Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

1. A command terminal
2. A text editor
    >**Tip:** Preferably, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Ballerina extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.ballerina) installed.
3. A [Ballerina installation](https://ballerina.io/learn/installing-ballerina/setting-up-ballerina/)

## Creating the Service Definition

In an RPC program, the first step is to define the service interface using an Interface Definition Language(IDL).
gRPC commonly uses Protocol Buffers as the IDL. Let's write a simple service definition in Protocol Buffers as below.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package helloworld;

// The greeting service definition.
service Greeter {
 // Sends a greeting.
 rpc sayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

// The request message with the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
 string name = 1;
}

// The response message with the greetings.
message HelloReply {
 string message = 1;
}
```
> **Note:** The sample service definition is taken from the quick start guide on the gRPC official site.

Let’s start implementing a Ballerina service and client for the above definition.

## Implementation

As illustrated in the diagram below, you first need to compile the service definition file (i.e., `helloworld.proto`), and generate the source code for both the client and service applications. In Ballerina, you can generate the source code using the built-in `Protocol Buffers to Ballerina` tool.

![gRPC Getting Started](/learn/images/grpc-getting-started.png)

Let’s walk through the instructions on implementing the gRPC service and client in the Ballerina language.

### Developing a gRPC Service

As with any other Ballerina Program, you need to create a Ballerina project. Then, you can generate the service code in the project and write the business logic.

#### Creating a Ballerina Project

Execute the following command to create a new Ballerina project in the directory that you want to create the project.

```bash
$ bal new greeter_service
```

> **Note:** For more information on creating Ballerina packages, please see the [link](/learn/getting-started-with-ballerina).

Remove the automatically-created `main.bal` file as you are not going to use it in this guide.

#### Generating the Source Code

Execute the following command inside the Ballerina project directory to generate source code related to the service definition.

```bash
$ bal grpc --mode service --input helloworld.proto --output greeter_service/
```

Once successfully executed, you will see the output below.

```bash
Successfully extracted the library files.
Successfully generated the Ballerina file.
```

Once you move into the directory, you will see the following two files,

```bash
greeter_service
├── - - -
├── greeter_service.bal
└── helloworld_pb.bal
```

Here,
- The `helloworld_pb.bal` file is the stub file. It contains classes that the client/service uses to talk to each other
and the Ballerina types corresponding to the request and response messages.
- The `greeter_service.bal` file is the service template file. It contains service(s) with all the remote methods
  defined in the PROTO file.

#### Update and Run the Application

Let’s update the service template file (i.e., `greeter_service.bal`) and add the business logic to the remote method. In this case, you only need to update the `sayHello` method as shown below.

```ballerina
import ballerina/grpc;

listener grpc:Listener grpcListener = new (9090);

@grpc:ServiceDescriptor {descriptor: ROOT_DESCRIPTOR_HELLOWORLD, descMap: getDescriptorMapHelloworld()}
service "Greeter" on grpcListener {

   remote function sayHello(HelloRequest value) returns HelloReply|error {
       return { message: "Hello " + value.name};
   }
}
```

In this code,
- The Listener declaration creates a new gRPC listener with port 9090. The listener is the entity that listens to the
input coming to the port and then dispatches it to the correct service(s).
- The service declaration creates a service and attaches it to the listener. The service annotation is to create an
  internal mapping between the service declarations and the PROTO definition. Do not change it.
- The gRPC service can have one or more remote methods depending on the proto definition. Here, this service has only one
  method called `sayHello` that has the `HelloRequest` type as the request and `HelloReply` type as the response.

Let’s run this project in your terminal:

```bash
$ bal run
Compiling source
	example/greeter_service:0.1.0

Running executable
```

Now you completed the server-side implementation, and it is running on port 9090. Let’s move on to the gRPC client-side implementation.

### Developing a gRPC Client

Similar to the service, the client application also starts with creating a new Ballerina project. Once created, you can generate the client code and update the code to call the remote methods exposed by the service.

#### Creating a Ballerina Project

Execute the following command to create a new Ballerina project in the directory that you want to create the project.

```bash
$ bal new greeter_client
```

> **Note:** For more information on creating Ballerina packages, please see the [link](/learn/getting-started-with-ballerina).

Remove the automatically-created `main.bal` file as you are not going to use it in this guide.

#### Generating the source code

Execute the following command inside the Ballerina project directory to generate source code related to the service definition.

```bash
$ bal grpc --mode client --input helloworld.proto --output greeter_client/
```

Once successfully executed, you could be able to view the below output.
```
Successfully extracted the library files.
Successfully generated the Ballerina file.
```

Once you move into the directory, you will see the following two new files.
```
greeter_client
├── - - -
├── greeter_client.bal
└── helloworld_pb.bal
```

Here,
- The `helloworld_pb.bal` file is the stub file that contains the classes that the client/service uses to talk to each
other and the Ballerina types corresponding to request and response messages.
- The `greeter_client.bal` file is the client template file that contains the `main` function with the client declaration.

#### Update and Run the application

Let’s update the client template file (i.e., `greeter_client.bal`) and write code to call the remote function in the server and get the server response back. Sample code is as follows,

```ballerina
import ballerina/io;

GreeterClient ep = check new ("http://localhost:9090");
public function main() returns error? {
   HelloReply sayHello = check ep->sayHello({name: "Ballerina"});
   io:println(`Response : ${sayHello.message}`);
}
```

In this code,

- The client declaration creates a connection to the remote server which is listening on port 9090. The generated client has remote methods that can use to talk to a remote server.
- The `main` function contains the statements that call the `sayHello` remote function and prints the response to the
  console.

Let’s run this project in your terminal:

```bash
$ bal run
Compiling source
	example/greeter_client:0.1.0

Running executable
```

Since the server is up and running, once the client application is successfully executed, the client application
invokes the `sayHello` function with the  `HelloRequest` message and receives the `HelloReply` as the response. You will
see the output below printed on the console.

```
Response : Hello Ballerina
```
