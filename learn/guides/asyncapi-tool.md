intro: AsyncAPI is a specification, which is used to describe and document message-driven APIs in a machine-readable format for easy development, discovery, and integration. Ballerina Swan Lake supports the AsyncAPI Specification version 2.x.

The Ballerina AsyncAPI tool will make it easy for you to start the development of an event API documented in an AsyncAPI contract in Ballerina by generating a Ballerina service and listener skeletons.

> **Prerequisite:** Install the latest [Ballerina Swan Lake distribution](https://ballerina.io/downloads/).

## Prepare the AsyncAPI Contract

Before using the tool, there are some modifications that should be made by adding some custom tags to the contract.

Consider the AsyncAPI spec for Slack as an example, To make it simple, a small part of the specification will be used (Find the complete specification [here](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/asyncapi-triggers/blob/main/asyncapi/slack/asyncapi.yml))

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.1.0
x-ballerina-event-identifier:
 type: "body"
 path: "event.type"
components:
 schemas:
   GenericEventWrapper:
     additionalProperties: true
     description: Adapted from auto-generated content
     properties:
       event:
         additionalProperties: true
         properties:
           event_ts:
             title: When the event was dispatched
             type: string
           type:
             title: The specific name of the event
             type: string
           text:
             title: The message content
             type: string
         required:
           - type
           - event_ts
         title: "The actual event, an object, that happened"
         type: object
     required:
       - event
     title: Standard event wrapper for the Events API
     type: object
channels:
 app:
   subscribe:
     message:
       oneOf:
         - x-ballerina-event-type: "app_mention"
           externalDocs:
             description: Event documentation for app_mention
           payload:
             $ref: "#/components/schemas/GenericEventWrapper"
           summary: Subscribe to only the message events that mention your app or bot
           tags:
             - name: allows_user_tokens
             - name: app_event
           x-scopes-required: []
           x-tokens-allowed:
             - user
	   - x-ballerina-event-type: "app_rate_limited"
           externalDocs:
             description: Event documentation for app_rate_limited
           payload:
             $ref: "#/components/schemas/GenericEventWrapper"
           summary: Indicates your app's event subscriptions are being rate limited
           tags:
             - name: allows_user_tokens
             - name: app_event
             - name: allows_workspace_tokens
           x-scopes-required: []
           x-tokens-allowed:
             - user
             - workspace
```

There are custom tags in this yaml starting with `x-ballerina`. It is very important that these tags must be added to the AsyncAPI contract before using the tool. Here is why and for what those tags are being used,

1\. `x-ballerina-event-identifier` - When the listener receives an event from the event source (Slack is the event source in this scenario), there should be a way to identify the event type. This includes two parts, `type` and `path`.

- type - Type can be either header or body. In other words, the type of the event can be included in the payload either as a http header or as an attribute in the body.

  > **Note:** Currently, this tool supports only the body property. Hence the path is equal to the JSON path of the attribute.

- path - Path is equal to the header-name if the type is header or the json path of the attribute if the type is body.

  > **Note:** Currently, this tool supports only HTTP-based event APIs.

2\. `x-ballerina-event-type` - This should be there in every event inside the channel. This is the name of the event or the value of the above mentioned attribute for a specific event.

## Generate Ballerina services from AsyncAPI Contracts

After modifying the AsyncAPI contract, the Ballerina sources can be generated using the below commands.

```bash
bal asyncapi [-i | --input] <asyncapi-contract-file-path> [-o | --output] <output-location>
```

The generated service can be used as a code template to start the service implementation.
For example,

```bash
bal asyncapi -i hello.yaml
```

This generates a Ballerina source (i.e., the four Ballerina files below) from the given AsyncAPI definition file.

1. `data_types.bal` - contains all the Ballerina data types extracted from the AsyncAPI definition
2. `service_types.bal` - contains all the service types relevant to the event API described in the AsyncAPI definition
3. `listener.bal` - contains the HTTP listener, which listens to the relevant third-party service
4. `dispacther_service.bal` - contains the event dispatching logic

The generated Ballerina sources will be written into the same directory from which the command is run. The above command can be run from anywhere on the execution path. It is not mandatory to run it from within a Ballerina package. If you want to generate Ballerina sources to a specific provided output location, you can modify the above command as below.

```bash
bal asyncapi -i hello.yaml -o ./output_path
```

Then, the generated files can be modified according to the custom requirements. When modifying the generated code segments, it will be easier to consider the below facts

- All the incoming requests will be coming to the resource function in the dispatcher_service.bal file. Hence, if there is a necessity to add an authentication logic for the incoming calls, that logic can be included there before processing the incoming http request.
- If more information is needed when initializing the listener like secrets, endpoint urls, tokens, refresh tokens and so on, update the init function in the listener.bal

## Execute the Generated Sources

In order to execute the generated Ballerina sources, please follow the below steps,

1. Go inside the folder where the generated files exist
2. Execute the command `bal init` - this will generate a Ballerina.toml file
3. Create a new ballerina file inside the folder (Ex: slack_service.bal ) and use this piece of code

```ballerina
listener Listener webhookListener = new(8090);

service AppService on webhookListener {
   remote function onAppMention(GenericEventWrapper event) returns error? {
       //implement the logic to use the received `event` here.
   }
}
```

Thatâ€™s it, You can execute the command `bal run` to execute this.

Below are some example libraries generated using the tool.
