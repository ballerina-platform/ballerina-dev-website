A package uses Ballerina library packages as dependencies. Use the `bal new` command to create a library package.

## Create a library package

Execute the `bal new -t lib` command to create a new library package.

```bash
bal new --template lib hello
```

This will create the `Ballerina.toml` file, the `hello.bal` source file, the `Package.md`, the `resources/`, `tests/` directories, and `Module.md`.
 For more information on these files, see [Package layout](/learn/package-references/#package-layout).

```bash
> cd hello
> tree .
    .
    ├── Ballerina.toml
    ├── Module.md
    ├── Package.md
    ├── hello.bal
    ├── resources
    └── tests
        └── lib_test.bal

2 directories, 5 files
```

You can edit the `Ballerina.toml` file to change the org name, package name, and version as you prefer.

```toml
[package]
org = "user"
name = "hello"
version = "0.1.0"

[build-options]
observabilityIncluded = true
```

Execute the `bal pack` command to generate the Ballerina archive.

```bash
bal pack
Compiling source
	user/hello:0.1.0

Creating bala
	target/bala/user-hello-any-0.1.0.bala
```

## Publish a library package to Ballerina Central

You can publish a Ballerina archive to the [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/).
Before you publish, ensure the package works as intended because a publish is **permanent**. Once published to Ballerina Central, you cannot overwrite the version or remove the package. However, the number of package versions you can push to Ballerina Central is not restricted.

>**Tip:** As a precaution, use the [local repository](/learn/managing-dependencies/#using-dependencies-from-the-local-repository) first to test out the functionality of the library package before publishing it to Ballerina Central.


### Prepare for publishing

1. Create an account on Ballerina Central. To register, [visit the home page](https://central.ballerina.io) and log in via a Google or GitHub account.

2. Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://central.ballerina.io/dashboard?tab=token) and acquire an access token.

3. Download and place the `Settings.toml` file in your home repository (`<USER_HOME>/.ballerina/`). If you already have a `Settings.toml` file configured in your home repository, follow the other option and copy the access token into the `Settings.toml`. 
   If you are connected to the internet via an HTTP proxy, add the following section to `Settings.toml` and change accordingly.

```toml
[proxy]
host = "localhost"
port = "3128"
username = ""
password = ""
```

### Organizations

When you push a package to Ballerina Central, the organizations are validated against the value of the `org` field defined in the [Ballerina.toml](/learn/package-references/#the-ballerinatoml-file) file. Therefore, when you have more than one organization in Ballerina Central, pick the organization name that you intend to push the package into, set that as the `org` in the `Ballerina.toml` file inside the package directory, and rebuild the package.If you don't have any organizations created, you can visit the [organizations page](https://central.ballerina.io/dashboard?tab=organizations) to create one.

Also, organization names starting with `ballerina` (e.g., `ballerina`, `ballerinax`, `ballerinai`, etc.) are reserved for system use, and you cannot publish any packages starting with the `ballerina` prefix to Ballerina Central. Therefore, if you have used a name pattern matching this, update the `Ballerina.toml` and rebuild the package.

### Publish the package

Now, that you are ready to publish, execute the command below to publish the package to Ballerina Central.

```bash
bal push
```

## Use the packages in Ballerina Central

After publishing your first package, you can create a second package and use the already published package in it.
Any package published in Ballerina Central is public and can be used in other packages.
 For more information, see [Importing a module](/learn/managing-dependencies/#importing-a-module).
