## Providing Observability in Ballerina

Monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing are key methods that reveal the internal state of the system to provide the observability. Ballerina becomes fully observable by exposing itself via these three methods to various external systems allowing to monitor metrics such as request count and response time statistics, analyze logs, and
perform distributed tracing. 

HTTP/HTTPS based Ballerina services and any client connectors are observable by default. HTTP/HTTPS and SQL client
connectors use semantic tags to make tracing and metrics monitoring more informative.

This guide focuses on enabling Ballerina service observability with some of its default supported systems.
[Prometheus] and [Grafana] are used for metrics monitoring, and [Jaeger] is used for distributed tracing. 
Ballerina logs can be fed to any external log monitoring system like [Elastic Stack] to perform log monitoring and analysis.


## Observing a Ballerina Service

Follow the steps below to observe a sample Ballerina service.

### Step 1 - Setting Up the Prerequisites

Make sure you have already installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to setup external products such as Jaeger,
Prometheus, etc. You can follow [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to install Docker.

### Step 2 - Installing and Configuring the External Systems

* Setup Prometheus for collecting metrics information by following section on [Setting up Prometheus](#prometheus)
* Setup Grafana to visualize metrics by following section on [Setting up Grafana](#grafana)
* Setup Jaeger analyze tracing as mentioned in section [Setting up Jaeger](#jaeger-server)
* Setup Elastic Stack only if you are interested in analysing logs by following section on [Setting up Elastic Stack](#elastic-stack)

### Step 3 - Creating a 'Hello World' Ballerina Service
 
Create a Service as shown below and save it as `hello_world_service.bal`.

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/log;

service hello on new http:Listener(9090) {
    
    resource function sayHello (http:Caller caller, http:Request req) returns error? {
        log:printInfo("This is a test Info log");
        log:printError("This is a test Error log");
        log:printWarn("This is a test Warn log");
        http:Response res = new;
        res.setPayload("Hello, World!");
        check caller->respond(res);
    }
    
}
```

### Step 4 - Observing the 'Hello World' Ballerina Service

Observability is disabled by default and can be enabled by using the `--b7a.observability.enabled=true` flag or updating the configurations.

When Ballerina observability is enabled, Ballerina runtime exposes internal metrics via an HTTP endpoint for metrics
monitoring and tracers will be published to Jaeger. Prometheus should be configured to scrape metrics from
the metrics HTTP endpoint in Ballerina.

Ballerina logs are logged on to the console. Therefore, the logs need to be redirected to a file, which can then be
pushed to [Elastic Stack](#distributed-logging) to perform the log analysis.

#### Starting the Service Using a Flag

The Ballerina service is observable with default settings when the `--b7a.observability.enabled=true` flag is used along with the Ballerina
`run` command to start the service.
This lets you to collect the distributed tracing information with Jaeger and metrics information with Prometheus.

```bash
$ ballerina run hello_world_service.bal --b7a.observability.enabled=true

[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9797
ballerina: started Prometheus HTTP listener 0.0.0.0:9797
ballerina: started publishing tracers to Jaeger on localhost:5775
[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9090
```

Redirect the standard output to a file if you want to monitor logs.

For example:

```bash
$ nohup ballerina run hello_world_service.bal --b7a.observability.enabled=true > ballerina.log &
```

#### Starting the Service Using a Configuration File

Observability of Ballerina service can also be enabled from the configuration. Create a configuration file such as `ballerina.conf` and add configuration below that starts metrics monitoring and distributed tracing with default 
settings.

```toml
[b7a.observability.metrics]
# Flag to enable Metrics
enabled=true

[b7a.observability.tracing]
# Flag to enable Tracing
enabled=true
```

The created configuration file can be passed to the Ballerina program with `--b7a.config.file` option along with
the path of the configuration file.

```bash
$ ballerina run hello_world_service.bal --b7a.config.file=<path-to-conf>/ballerina.conf

[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9797
ballerina: started Prometheus HTTP listener 0.0.0.0:9797
ballerina: started publishing tracers to Jaeger on localhost:5775
[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9090
```

Redirect the standard output to a file if you want to monitor logs.

For example:
```bash
$ nohup ballerina run hello_world_service.bal --b7a.config.file=<path-to-conf>/ballerina.conf > ballerina.log &
```

### Step 5 - Sending Few Requests
 
Send few requests to <http://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello>

Example cURL command:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello
```

### Step 6 - Viewing Tracing and Metrics in the Dashboard

View the tracing information on Jaeger via <http://localhost:16686/> and view metrics information from Grafana
dashboard on <http://localhost:3000/>.

Sample view of Jaeger dashboard for hello_world_service.bal is shown below. 
![Jaeger Sample Dashboard](../images/jaeger-sample-dashboard.png "Jaeger Sample Dashboard")

Sample view of Grafana dashboard for hello_world_service.bal is shown below. 
![Grafana Sample Dashboard](../images/grafana-sample-hello-world-service-stats.png "Grafana HelloWorld Service Sample Dashboard")

### Step 7 - Visualizing the Logs
 
If you have configured log analytics, view the logs in Kibana via <http://localhost:5601>

![Kibana Sample Dashboard](../images/kibana-sample-dashboard.png "Kibana Sample Dashboard")

## Monitoring Metrics
Metrics help to monitor the runtime behaviour of a service. Therefore, metrics is a vital part of monitoring
Ballerina services. However, metrics is not the same as analytics. For example, you should not use metrics to do
something like per-request billing. Metrics are used to measure what Ballerina service does at runtime to make
better decisions using the numbers. The code generates business value when it continuously run in production.
Therefore, it is imperative to continuously measure the code in production.

Metrics, by default, supports Prometheus. In order to support Prometheus, an HTTP endpoint starts with the context
of `/metrics` in default port 9797 when starting the Ballerina service.

### Configuring Advanced Metrics for Ballerina
This section focuses on the Ballerina configurations that are available for metrics monitoring with Prometheus,
and the sample configuration is provided below.

```toml
[b7a.observability.metrics]
enabled=true
reporter="prometheus"

[b7a.observability.metrics.prometheus]
port=9797
host="0.0.0.0"
```

The descriptions of each configuration above are provided below with possible alternate options.

Configuration Key | Description | Default Value | Possible Values 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
b7a.observability.metrics. enabled | Whether metrics monitoring is enabled (true) or disabled (false) | false | true or false
b7a.observability.metrics. reporter | Reporter name that reports the collected Metrics to the remote metrics server. This is only required to be modified if a custom reporter is implemented and needs to be used. | prometheus | prometheus or if any custom implementation, then name of the reporter.
b7a.observability.metrics. prometheus.port | The value of the port in which the service '/metrics' will bind to. This service will be used by Prometheus to scrape the information of the Ballerina service. | 9797 | Any suitable value for port 0 - 0 - 65535. However, within that range, ports 0 - 1023 are generally reserved for specific purposes, therefore it is advisable to select a port without that range. 
b7a.observability.metrics. prometheus.host | The name of the host in which the service '/metrics' will bind to. This service will be used by Prometheus to scrape the information of the Ballerina service. | 0.0.0.0 | IP or Hostname or 0.0.0.0 of the node in which the Ballerina service is running.

### Setting Up the External Systems for Metrics
There are mainly two systems involved in collecting and visualizing the metrics. [Prometheus] is used to collect the
metrics from the Ballerina service and [Grafana] can connect to Prometheus and visualize the metrics in the dashboard.

#### Setting Up Prometheus

[Prometheus] is used as the monitoring system, which pulls out the metrics collected from the Ballerina service
'/metrics'. This section focuses on the quick installation of Prometheus with Docker, and configure it to collect 
metrics from Ballerina service with default configurations. Below provided steps needs to be followed to configure 
Prometheus. There are many other ways to install the Prometheus and you can find possible options from
[installation guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/).

1. Create a `prometheus.yml` file in `/tmp/` directory.

2. Add the following content to `/tmp/prometheus.yml`.

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['a.b.c.d:9797']
```

Here the targets `'a.b.c.d:9797'` should contain the host and port of the `/metrics` service that's exposed from 
Ballerina for metrics collection. Add the IP of the host in which the Ballerina service is running as `a.b.c.d` and its
port (default `9797`).
If you need more information refer [official documentation of Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/).

3. Start the Prometheus server in a Docker container with below command.

```bash
$ docker run -p 19090:9090 -v /tmp/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
```
    
4. Go to <http://localhost:19090/> and check whether you can see the Prometheus graph.
Ballerina metrics should appear in Prometheus graph's metrics list when Ballerina service is started.

#### Setting Up Grafana

Let’s use [Grafana] to visualize metrics in a dashboard. For this, we need to install Grafana, and configure
Prometheus as a datasource. Follow the steps below to configure Grafana.

1. Start Grafana as Docker container with the command below.

```bash
$ docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```
For more information refer [Grafana in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana/).

2. Go to <http://localhost:3000/> to access the Grafana dashboard running on Docker.

3. Login to the dashboard with default user, username: `admin` and password: `admin`

4. Add Prometheus as datasource with `Browser` access configuration as provided below.

![Grafana Prometheus Datasource](../images/grafana-prometheus-datasource.png "Grafana Prometheus Datasource")

5. Import the Grafana dashboard designed to visualize Ballerina metrics from [https://grafana.com/dashboards/5841](https://grafana.com/dashboards/5841).
This dashboard consists of service and client invocation level metrics in near real-time view. 

Ballerina HTTP Service Metrics Dashboard Panel will be as below.
![Ballerina Service Metrics](../images/grafana-ballerina-metrics-1.png "Ballerina Sample Service Metrics Dashboard")

Ballerina HTTP Client Metrics Dashboard Panel will be as below.
![Ballerina Client Metrics](../images/grafana-ballerina-metrics-3.png "Ballerina Sample Client Metrics Dashboard")

Ballerina SQL Client Metrics Dashboard Panel will be as below.
![Ballerina SQL Client Metrics](../images/grafana-ballerina-metrics-2.png "Ballerina Sample SQL Client Metrics Dashboard")

## Distributed Tracing

Tracing provides information regarding the roundtrip of a service invocation based on the concept of spans, which are
structured in a hierarchy based on the cause and effect concept. Tracers propagate across several services that can be
deployed in several nodes, depicting a high-level view of interconnections among services as well, hence coining the
term distributed tracing.

A span is a logical unit of work, which encapsulates a start and end time as well as metadata to give more meaning to
the unit of work being completed. For example, a span representing a client call to an HTTP endpoint would give the
user the latency of the client call and metadata like the HTTP URL being called and HTTP method used. If the span
represents an SQL client call, the metadata would include the query being executed.

Tracing gives the user a high-level view of how a single service invocation is processed across several distributed
microservices.

* Identify service bottlenecks - The user can monitor the latencies and identify when a service invocation slows down,
pinpoint where the slowing down happens (by looking at the span latencies) and take action to improve the latency.
* Error identification - If an error occurs during the service invocation, it will show up in the list of tracers.
The user can easily identify where the error occurred and information of the error will be attached to the relevant
span as metadata.

Ballerina supports [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/) standards by default. This means that Ballerina services
can be traced using OpenTracing implementations like [Jaeger](http://www.jaegertracing.io/), and
[Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/). Jaeger is the default tracer of Ballerina.

Semantic tags used by Ballerina also follow the [semantic conventions defined in OpenTracing
specification.](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/semantic_conventions.md)

### Configuring Advanced Tracing for Ballerina

Tracing can be enabled in Ballerina with `--b7a.observability.enabled=true` flag as mentioned in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section, as well as configuration option. This section mainly focuses on the configuration options with description and possible values.

The sample configuration that enables tracing, and uses Jaeger as the sample tracer as provided below.

```toml
[b7a.observability.tracing]
enabled=true
name="jaeger"
```

The table below provides the descriptions of each configuration option and possible values that can be assigned.

Configuration Key | Description | Default Value | Possible Values
--- | --- | --- | --- 
b7a.observability.tracing.enabled | Whether tracing is enabled (true) or disabled (false) | false | true or false
b7a.observability.tracing.name | Tracer name which implements tracer interface. | jaeger | jaeger or zipkin

#### Using the Jaeger Client
Jaeger is the default tracer supported by Ballerina. Below is the sample configuration options that are available in
the Jaeger.

```toml
[b7a.observability.tracing]
enabled=true
name="jaeger"

[b7a.observability.tracing.jaeger.sampler]
type="const"
param=1.0

[b7a.observability.tracing.jaeger.reporter]
hostname="localhost"
port=5775

[b7a.observability.tracing.jaeger.reporter.flush.interval]
ms=2000

[b7a.observability.tracing.jaeger.reporter.max.buffer]
spans=1000
```

The below table provides the descriptions of each configuration option and possible values that can be assigned.

Configuration Key | Description | Default Value | Possible Values 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
b7a.observability.tracing. jaeger.reporter.hostname | Hostname of the Jaeger server | localhost | IP or hostname of the Jaeger server. If it is running on the same node as Ballerina, it can be localhost. 
b7a.observability.tracing. jaeger.reporter.port | Port of the Jaeger server | 5775 | The port which the Jaeger server is listening to.
b7a.observability.tracing. jaeger.sampler.type | Type of the sampling methods used in the Jaeger tracer. | const | `const`, `probabilistic`, or `ratelimiting`.
b7a.observability.tracing. jaeger.sampler.param | It is a floating value. Based on the sampler type, the effect of the sampler param varies | 1.0 | For `const` `0` (no sampling) or `1` (sample all spans), for `probabilistic` `0.0` to `1.0`, for `ratelimiting` any positive integer (rate per second).
b7a.observability.tracing. jaeger.reporter.flush.interval.ms | Jaeger client will be sending the spans to the server at this interval. | 2000 | Any positive integer value.
b7a.observability.tracing. jaeger.reporter.max.buffer.spans | Queue size of the Jaeger client. | 2000 | Any positive integer value.

#### Using the Zipkin Client
The tracing of Ballerina service can be done via Zipkin as well, but the required dependencies are not included in
default Ballerina distribution. Follow the steps below to add the required dependencies to the Ballerina distribution.

1. Go to [ballerina-observability](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-observability) and clone
the GitHub repository in any preferred location.

2. Make sure you have installed [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

3. Open the command line and build the repository by using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) with the command below while being in the root project directory `ballerina-observability`.

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

4. Go to the path - `ballerina-observability/tracing-extensions/modules/ballerina-zipkin-extension/target/` and
extract `distribution.zip`.

5. Copy all the JAR files inside the `distribution.zip` to 'bre/lib' directory in the Ballerina distribution.

6. Add following configuration to the `Ballerina.toml` of your module. 

```toml
[platform]
target = "java8"

    [[platform.libraries]]
    artifactId = "ballerina-zipkin-extension"
    version = "1.0.0-rc1-SNAPSHOT"
    path = "/<absolute_path_to>/ballerina-zipkin-extension-1.0.0-rc1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
    groupId = "org.ballerinalang"
    modules = ["yourModuleName"]

    [[platform.libraries]]
    artifactId = "brave-opentracing"
    version = "4.17.1"
    path = "/<absolute_path_to>/brave-4.17.1.jar"
    groupId = "io.opentracing.brave"
    modules = ["yourModuleName"]

    [[platform.libraries]]
    artifactId = "brave"
    version = "0.29.0"
    path = "/<absolute_path_to>/brave-opentracing-0.29.0.jar"
    groupId = "io.zipkin.brave"
    modules = ["yourModuleName"]

    [[platform.libraries]]
    artifactId = "zipkin-reporter"
    version = "2.6.1"
    path = "/<absolute_path_to>/zipkin-2.6.1.jar"
    groupId = "io.zipkin.reporter2"
    modules = ["yourModuleName"]

    [[platform.libraries]]
    artifactId = "zipkin"
    version = "2.5.0"
    path = "/<absolute_path_to>/zipkin-reporter-2.5.0.jar"
    groupId = "io.zipkin.zipkin2"
    modules = ["yourModuleName"]

    [[platform.libraries]]
    artifactId = "zipkin-sender-okhttp3"
    version = "2.5.0"
    path = "/<absolute_path_to>/zipkin-sender-okhttp3-2.5.0.jar"
    groupId = "io.zipkin.reporter2"
    modules = ["yourModuleName"]

    [[platform.libraries]]
    artifactId = "zipkin-sender-urlconnection"
    version = "2.5.0"
    path = "/<absolute_path_to>/zipkin-sender-urlconnection-2.5.0.jar"
    groupId = "io.zipkin.reporter2"
    modules = ["yourModuleName"]

    [[platform.libraries]]
    artifactId = "kotlin-stdlib"
    version = "1.3.31"
    path = "/<absolute_path_to>/kotlin-stdlib-1.3.31.jar"
    groupId = "org.jetbrains.kotlin"
    modules = ["yourModuleName"]
```

7. Change the following configuration name to Zipkin. This ensures that all tracers are sent to Zipkin instead
of the default Jaeger tracer.

```toml
[b7a.observability.tracing]
name="zipkin"
```

8. The following configuration is a sample configuration option available for Zipkin tracer.

```toml
[b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin.reporter]
hostname="localhost"
port=9411

[b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin.reporter.api]
context="/api/v2/spans"
version="v2"

[b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin.reporter.compression]
enabled=true
```

The table below provides the descriptions of each configuration option and possible values that can be assigned. 

Configuration Key | Description | Default Value | Possible Values 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin. reporter.hostname | Hostname of the Zipkin server | localhost | IP or hostname of the Zipkin server. If it is running on the same node as Ballerina, it can be localhost. 
b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin. reporter.port | Port of the Zipkin server | 9411 | The port that the Zipkin server is listening to.
b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin. reporter.api.context | API context of the Zipkin server | `/api/v2/spans` | The API context of the Zipkin API. For V1 API, the context will be `/api/v1/spans`, and for V2 API, the context will be `/api/v2/spans` for default Zipkin server.
b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin. reporter.api.version | API version of the Zipkin API | v2 | v1 or v2.
b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin. reporter.compression.enabled | Enable the compression for the spans request | true | true or false.

### Setting Up the External Systems for Tracing
Ballerina by default supports Jaerger and Zipkin for distributed tracing. This section focuses on configuring the
Jaeger and Zipkin with Dockers as a quick installation.

#### Setting Up the Jaeger Server
Jaeger is the default distributed tracing system that is supported. There are many possible ways to deploy Jaeger and you can find more information on this [link](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/deployment/). Here we focus on all in one deployment with Docker.

1. Install Jaeger via Docker and start the Docker container by executing below command.

```bash
$ docker run -d -p5775:5775/udp -p6831:6831/udp -p6832:6832/udp -p5778:5778 -p16686:16686 -p14268:14268 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

2. Go to <http://localhost:16686> and load the web UI of the Jaeger to make sure it is functioning properly.

The image below is the sample tracing information you can see from Jaeger.

![Jaeger Tracing Dashboard](../images/jaeger-tracing-dashboard.png "Jaeger Tracing Dashboard")

#### Setting Up the Zipkin Server
Similar to Jaeger, Zipkin is another distributed tracing system that is supported by the Ballerina. There are many
different configurations and deployment exist for Zipkin, please go to [link](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin)
for more information. Here we focus on all in one deployment with Docker.

3. Install Zipkin via Docker and start the Docker container by executing following command.

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```

4. Go to <http://localhost:9411/zipkin/> and load the web UI of the Zipkin to make sure it is functioning
properly. The sample Zipkin dashboard for the hello world sample in the [Quick Start](/learn/quick-tour) is shown below.

![Zipkin Sample](../images/zipkin-sample.png "Zipkin Sample")

## Distributed Logging
Ballerina distributed logging and analysis is supported by Elastic Stack. Ballerina has a log module for logging in to 
the console. In order to monitor the logs, the Ballerina standard output needs to be redirected to a file.

This can be done by running the Ballerina service as below.

```bash
$ nohup ballerina run hello_world_service.bal > ballerina.log &
```

You can view the logs with command below.

```bash
$ tail -f ~/wso2-ballerina/workspace/ballerina.log
```

### Setting Up the External Systems for Log Analytics

#### Setting Up Elastic Stack
The elastic stack comprises of the following components.

1. Beats - Multiple agents that ship data to Logstash or Elasticsearch. In our context, Filebeat will ship the Ballerina logs to Logstash. Filebeat should be a container running on the same host as the Ballerina service. This is so that the log file (ballerina.log) can be mounted to the Filebeat container.
2. Logstash - Used to process and structure the log files received from Filebeat and send to Elasticsearch.
3. Elasticsearch - Storage and indexing of the logs received by Logstash.
4. Kibana - Visualizes the data stored in Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch and Kibana are provided as [Cloud Services](https://www.elastic.co/cloud)
Alternatively, Docker containers can be used to set up Elasticsearch and Kibana as well.

1. Download the Docker images using the following commands.

```bash
# Elasticsearch Image
$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.5.1
# Kibana Image
$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:6.5.1
# Filebeat Image
$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:6.5.1
# Logstash Image
$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:6.5.1
```

2. Start Elasticsearch and Kibana containers by executing the following commands.

```bash
$ docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -it -h elasticsearch --name elasticsearch docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.5.1
$ docker run -p 5601:5601 -h kibana --name kibana --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:6.5.1
```

If you run on Linux you may have to increase the `vm.max_map_count` for the Elasticsearch container to start. 
Execute the following command to do that.

```bash
$ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

3. Create a `logstash.conf` file in the `/tmp/pipeline/` directory and include the following content in the file.

```
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
    }
}
filter {
  grok  {
    match => { "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:date}%{SPACE}%{WORD:logLevel}%{SPACE}\[%{GREEDYDATA:module}\]%{SPACE}\-%{SPACE}%{GREEDYDATA:logMessage}"}
  }
}
output {
    elasticsearch {
        hosts => "elasticsearch:9200"
        index => "ballerina"
      document_type => "ballerina_logs"
    }
}
```

Here the 3 stages are specified in the pipeline. Input is specified as beats and listens to port 5044. 
A grok filter is used to structure the Ballerina logs and the output is specified to push to Elasticsearch on
`elasticsearch:9200`.

4. Start the Logstash container by the following command.

```bash
$ docker run -h logstash --name logstash --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch -it --rm -v /tmp/pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/ -p 5044:5044 docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:6.5.1
```

5. Configure Filebeat to ship the Ballerina logs. Create a `filebeat.yml` file in the `/tmp/` directory and include the following content in the file.

```
filebeat.prospectors:
- type: log
  paths:
    - /usr/share/filebeat/ballerina.log
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["logstash:5044"]
```

6. Start the Filebeat container with the following command.

The `-v` flag is used for bind mounting, where the container will read the file from the host machine. Provide the path to the ballerina.log file, to be bind mounted to the filebeat container.

```bash
$ docker run -v /tmp/filebeat.yml:/usr/share/filebeat/filebeat.yml -v /<path-to-ballerina.log>/ballerina.log:/usr/share/filebeat/ballerina.log --link logstash:logstash docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:6.5.1
```

7. Access Kibana to visualize the logs at <http://localhost:5601>. Add an index named `ballerina` and click on `Discover` to visualize the logs.
