## Interacting With the Remote Client

This is done by optionally taking in the [`http:Caller`](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/clients/Caller) and [`http:Request`](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/classes/Request) typed parameters, which represent calling the remote client and the current request information respectively. 

The [`http:Caller`](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/clients/Caller) contains functionality to interact with the remote client such as responding to the client using the [`respond`](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/clients/Caller#respond) remote method. The [`http:Request`](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/classes/Request) object contains operations to look up information regarding the current incoming HTTP request such as the request payload, [query](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/classes/Request#getQueryParams/[matrix](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/classes/Request#getMatrixParams) parameters, [cookies](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/classes/Request#getCookies), and [headers](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/classes/Request#getHeaders).

## Example

The example below demonstrates this functionality in action. 

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
 
service / on new http:Listener(8080) {
 
   resource function post greeting(http:Caller caller,
                                   http:Request request) returns error? {
       string name = check request.getTextPayload();
       check caller->respond(string `Hello, ${name}!`);
   }
 
}
```

## Execution

The execution of the service and its invocation is shown below.

```bash
$ bal run demo.bal
 
[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:8080

$ curl -d "Jack" http://localhost:8080/greeting
Hello, Jack!
```

## Executing Additional Logic

Using this approach, you can also execute additional logic even after the response is sent back to the client. For example, in the case of a network issue when responding back to the client, you can do custom operations for failure-recovery or do extended logging operations. 

The [`respond`](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/clients/Caller#respond) remote method also takes in an [`http:Response`](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/classes/Response) object if you need finer control in the response such as setting the status code or overriding the default [content type](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/classes/Response#setContentType). 

### Example

The example below shows how you can send an HTTP 202 (Accepted) status code from your response.

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
 
service / on new http:Listener(8080) {
 
   resource function post greeting(http:Caller caller,
                                  http:Request request) returns error? {
       string name = check request.getTextPayload();
       http:Response resp = new;
       resp.setTextPayload(string `Hello, ${name}!`);
       resp.statusCode = 202;
       check caller->respond(resp);
   }
 
}
```

### Execution

The execution of the service and its invocation is shown below.

```bash
$ bal run demo.bal
 
[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:8080

$ curl -v -d "Jack" http://localhost:8080/greeting
