## Using the Annotation

To distinguish between query parameters and resource payload parameters, the parameters that represent the resource payload are annotated with [`@http:Payload`](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/annotations#Payload). The supported parameter types are `string`, `json`, `xml`, `byte[]`, record types, and record array types. 

## Example

An example of payload data binding is shown below.

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
 
service / on new http:Listener(8080) {
 
   resource function post upload/[string name](
                                  @http:Payload byte[] payload)
                                  returns string {
       return string `'${name}' uploaded with ${payload.length()} bytes`;
   }
 
}
```

## Execution

The execution of the service and its invocation is shown below.

```bash
$ bal run demo.bal
 
[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:8080

$ curl -d "XXXXXX" http://localhost:8080/upload/file1
'file1' uploaded with 6 bytes
```
