## Configuring Secure Communication

This is done by providing the optional `secureSocket` property in the [HTTP Listener Configuration](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/records/ListenerConfiguration) instance when creating the [`http:Listener`](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/listeners/Listener).

## Example of HTTPS Endpoint configured Public Certificate and Private Key

The example below shows how an HTTPS service is configured with public certificate and private key.

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;

listener http:Listener securedEP = new(9090,
    secureSocket = {
        key: {
            certFile: "/path/to/public.crt"
            keyFile: "/path/to/private.key",
        }
    }
);

service / on securedEP {
    resource function get greeting() returns string {
        return "Hello!";
    }
}
```

## Example of HTTPS Endpoint configured KeyStore

The example below shows how an HTTPS service is configured with KeyStore.

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
 
listener http:Listener securedEP = new(9090,
    secureSocket = {
        key: {
            path: "/path/to/keystore.p12"
            password: "password",
        }
    }
);
 
service / on securedEP {
    resource function get greeting() returns string {
        return "Hello!";
    }
}
```
