## Executing Tests Using CLI Commands

Tests will be automatically executed when you run the build command or you can explicitly run them using the test command. 

Execute all the tests in the current package with the following command.

```
$ bal test
```

List all the test groups in the package.

```
$ bal test --list-groups
```

Run only the tests belonging to the given group(s) in the current package.

```
$ bal test --groups <group_1>,<group_2>
```

Run the tests in the current package excluding the given group(s).

```
$ bal test --disable-groups <group_1>
```

Run only the given test function(s) in the current package.

```
$ bal test --tests <test_function>
```

Run a given set of functions in the default module only.

```
$ bal test --tests PackageName:<test_function>
```

Run all the functions in the given module.

```
$ bal test --tests PackageName.ModuleName:*
```

Run only the previously-failed test cases in the current package.

```
$ bal test --rerun-failed
```

Generate an HTML test report.

```
$ bal test --test-report
```

Generate the HTML test report with code coverage information.

```
$ bal test --code-coverage
```

For more options of the test command, run the following.

`$ bal test --help` 

## Test Report

By default, a summary of the test statuses is printed in the console at the end of the test execution.
In addition to the results printed in the console, an HTML test report can be generated by passing the `--test-report` flag in the Ballerina command. The link to the file will be printed in the console at the end of the test execution.
The test report contains the total passed, failed, and skipped tests of the entire package and of the individual modules.

***Example:***

```
$ bal test --test-report
```

A sample view of the test report is shown below.

## Code Coverage Report

The Ballerina test framework provides an option to analyze the code coverage of a standard Ballerina package.
This feature provides details about the coverage of the program source code by the tests executed.

You can pass the `--code-coverage`  flag in the test execution command and generate the code coverage report at the end of the test execution. The generated file is an extended version of the test report.
In addition to the test results, this file would contain details about the source code coverage at different levels.

*   Package-level coverage as an average
*   Module-level coverage as an average
*   Individual source file coverage

The code coverage only includes the Ballerina source files being tested and not any files under the **_tests/_** directory.

***Example:***

```
$ bal test --code-coverage
```
