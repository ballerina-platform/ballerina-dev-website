## Semantic and Syntactic Diagnostics

When there are syntax or semantic errors in your code, you will be notified with appropriate diagnostics during the development time. 

> **Tip**: The detailed description that appears when you hover over the lines underlined in red will be consistent with the error message that you get during compile-time.

## Suggestions and Auto Completion

The extension provides you with suggestions on keywords, variables, and code snippets of language constructs (such as functions, services, and iterable constructs etc.).

![Suggestions and auto completion](/learn/images/suggestions.gif)

> **Tip**: You can use these suggestions to access the contents of the modules available in your Ballerina home repo as well as in the Ballerina distribution.

## Code Actions

These allow you to perform the below tasks easily based on the diagnostics and the current scope where the cursor resides. 

- Add documentation for an entity such as a function, service, resource, object, record etc.
- Add documentation for all the available entities in the current file
- Add missing imports 
- Create variable definitions
- Create an undefined function

For example, you can add documentation for a function as shown below.

## Hover Support

 Hover support provides you quick access to information about a certain entity. 
 
 For an example, if you hover over a function name, you can view its description, information about its parameters, and the description of its return type as shown below.

 > **Tip**: Likewise, if you hover over an entity name of an object or a record, you can view the description of the object/record as well as descriptions of its fields.

## Go to definition

This option allows you to view the definition of a selected variable, function, an object etc. within the same file, in a separate file, in the same module, or in a file of a different module, of the same project or of the [Standard Library](/learn/api-docs/ballerina/).
