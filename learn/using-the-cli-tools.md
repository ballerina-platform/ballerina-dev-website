## Using the Ballerina Tool

The Ballerina Tool is a command-line tool for managing Ballerina source code. It helps you to manage Ballerina packages and modules, test, build, and run programs, etc.

It also enables you to easily install, update, and switch among Ballerina distributions. 

In the CLI, execute the `bal help` command to view all the actions you can perform with the Ballerina Tool as shown below:

```sh
→ bal help
NAME
       The Ballerina tool

SYNOPSIS
       bal <-v | --version>
       bal [command] <-h | --help>
       bal <command> [<args>]


DESCRIPTION
       Ballerina is a statically typed, concurrent programming language, focusing on network interaction and structured
       data. It is intended to be the core of a language-centric middleware platform. It has all the general-purpose
       functionality expected of a modern programming language, but it also has several unusual aspects that make it
       particularly suitable for its intended purpose.

       Find more information at: https://ballerina.io/


OPTIONS
       -v, --version
           Print the Ballerina version information.

       -h, --help
           Print usage details of a command.

Use 'bal help <command>' for more information on a specific command.
```

You can use it in the below format.

> `bal <THE-COMMAND> <ITS-ARGUEMENTS>`

> **Tip:** You can view details of the commands below by executing the `bal help <COMMAND>`. For example, the below is the output of the `bal help pull` command.

```sh
→ bal help pull
NAME
       ballerina-pull - Fetch packages from Ballerina Central

SYNOPSIS
       bal pull <org-name>/<package-name>[:<version>]


DESCRIPTION
       The pull command downloads the specified package from Ballerina Central
       along with its dependencies. It then caches this package in the
       '.ballerina' directory in the user home.

       Ballerina Central is a package repository hosted at
       https://central.ballerina.io/. A package repository organizes packages
       into a three-level hierarchy: organization, package name, and version.
       Organizations are unique within a repository and can be mapped to an
       individual user or organization registered with the repository.


EXAMPLES
       Pull the latest version of 'gmail' connector in 'wso2' organization
       from Ballerina Central.
          $ bal pull wso2/gmail

       Pull the '1.1.0' version of 'gmail' connector in 'wso2' organization
       from Ballerina Central.
          $ bal pull wso2/gmail:1.1.0
```
