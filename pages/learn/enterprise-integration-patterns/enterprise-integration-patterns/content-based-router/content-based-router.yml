name: Content-Based Router
tagline: Route messages based on message content
desc: Content-based router routes each message to the correct recipient based on message content.
helps: Ballerina supports conditional logic with if-else and match statements. This can be used to route messages based on message content, header, or any custom logic. Ballerina type system supports union types (e.g., `Country` enum below is a union), which helps to define choices in a type-safe and readable manner.
