desc: The content filter removes data from the original message and can also be employed to simplify the message structure.
helps: Ballerina excels at manipulating data, handling diverse formats, structures, and transformations. The query expression ('from' keyword)
       is useful for transforming messages. The 'select' clause, as shown below, can be used to create new records from existing ones while refining data.
       The 'where' clause can be used to filter items from an array.
