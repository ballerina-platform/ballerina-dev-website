tagline: Route messages to different output channels
desc: Message router consumes a message from one channel and republishes it to a different channel depending on a set of conditions.
helps: "Ballerina supports conditional logic with if-else and match statements. This can be used to route messages based on message content, header or any custom logic. Ballerina type system supports union types (eg: Country type below) which helps to define choices in a type safe and readable manner."
