tagline: Capture message information in a central location
desc: Message store captures information about each message in a central location.
helps: Ballerina can send messages to multiple channels during a single service invocation. Ballerina's concurrency model helps to send messages asynchronously without blocking the main channel. The wildcard binding pattern is used to indicate a 'fire-and-forget' invocation, where the response is not used.
