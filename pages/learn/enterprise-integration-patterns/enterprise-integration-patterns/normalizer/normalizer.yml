tagline: Process messages with different formats
desc: Normalizer routes each message type through a custom message translator so that the resulting messages match a common format.
category: Message Transformation
index: 40
helps: Ballerina's type test (`is` keyword) and match statement can both be used to test the structure of incoming data. Then the data can be transformed into the required format to construct new data structures. Ballerina's data-oriented design helps with complex transformations with features such as destructuring, query expressions, spread operator, etc.
