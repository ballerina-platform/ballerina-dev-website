tagline: Route messages to multiple recipients
desc: The recipient list pattern inspects an incoming message, determines the list of desired recipients, and forwards the message to all channels associated with the recipients in the list.
category: Message Routing
index: 27
helps: Ballerina can extract information from messages and execute logic based on that. Iteration constructs such as `foreach` and `while` and query expressions can be used to execute a given logic for each recipient. Ballerina supports sending multiple messages in a single incoming message.
