name: Scatter-Gather
tagline: Send messages to multiple recipients and re-aggregate the responses
desc: Scatter-gather broadcasts a message to multiple recipients and re-aggregates the responses back into a single message.
helps: Ballerina has a lightweight [concurrency](/learn/by-example/named-workers/) model with built-in syntax support. This helps to send messages parallelly and to wait on aggregation. Query expressions are convenient for transforming, ordering, and filtering the aggregated data.
