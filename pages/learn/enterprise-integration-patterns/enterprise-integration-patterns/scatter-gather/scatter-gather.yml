tagline: Send messages to multiple recipients and re-aggregate the responses
desc: Scatter gather broadcasts a message to multiple recipients and re-aggregates the responses back into a single message.
helps: Ballerina has a light-weight concurrency model with builtin syntax support. This helps to send messages parallelly and to wait on aggregation. Query expressions are convenient for transform/order/filter the aggregated data.
