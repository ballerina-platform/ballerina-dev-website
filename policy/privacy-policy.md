## What information do we collect?

1. **Information you share with us**

    When you register on the Ballerina Sites for updates or sign up for an event or service, or when you log in through single-sign-on through certain designated federated identity providers mentioned on the Sites, we may ask that you submit some or all of the following information:

    - Name
    - Email address
    - Profile picture
    - Language preference

    You may choose to visit our site anonymously without providing any of the above information. However, some services on our site may require that such details be entered on a mandatory basis. This is because those details are essential for us to be able to provide you with those services.

2. **Information collected automatically from your devices**

    We also collect certain standard information that Your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type, and language, access times, and referring website addresses. Our website may also place certain cookies to help you access our sites, and to track and analyze Your actions on our website such as navigation, number of visits, downloads, and search items to gain a better understanding of our visitors and their movements through the site. Please see our <a target="_blank" href="https://ballerina.io/cookie-policy/">cookie policy</a> on how we use and store cookies. 

4. **Information received from third parties**

    We may also receive Your personal data from other sources, including service providers, partners, and publicly available sources. Examples of these sources are event organizers of events we sponsor, sponsored content providers, and our partners, who pass on prospective customers to us. 

## Why do we collect your information?

The information we collect from you may be used to:

- **Provide services:** We use Your personal data to perform the services you request (for instance, if you’ve filled in a Contact Us form, we use Your information to get in touch with you).
- **Support and improve WSO2 offerings:** We use Your personal data to improve our Sites and services. We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the type of content our users click on or download. We also monitor usage to fix issues and to make improvements to our services or to provide offerings more relevant to You.
- **Carry out analysis:** We sometimes require Your personal data to analyze the ways in which our products and services are used or downloaded, what features are effective or popular, whether our marketing campaigns reach our intended audiences, and to track lead generation for our sales process.
- **Account creation and communication:** We use Your data to create Your online profile, which we create for every user who registers on our Site or for a service, and to send You communications about updates and changes to Your account or services.
- **Marketing:** To send marketing material, event invitations, and updates. You may opt out of these at any time.
- **Contests and surveys:** To administer a contest, survey, or other site feature.
- **Fraud and abuse detection:** We use Your personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect our users. 
- **Compliance with legal obligations:** Sometimes, we may have a legal obligation to collect, use, or record Your personal data, such as when you make a payment or submit a data subject request.

## How do we process your data?

We will only collect and process personal data about You where we have lawful bases for doing so. In the majority of cases, processing will be justified on the basis that:

- You have consented to the processing;
- The processing is necessary to perform a contract or to take steps to enter into a contract;
- The processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal obligation; or
- The processing is in our legitimate commercial interests and necessary for us to administer our business, subject to Your interests and fundamental rights.

Where we rely on Your consent to process personal data, You have the right to withdraw or decline Your consent at any time, and where we rely on legitimate interests, You have the right to object. If You have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use Your personal data or wish to withdraw consent or object, You can submit a request via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:dpo@wso2.com">dpo@wso2.com</a> or through the details listed in the [Information about data controllers, processors, and how to contact us](#information-about-data-controllers-processors-and-how-to-contact-us) section below.


## Who is your information shared with?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your information with outside parties. However, we do share your information with our subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers, and partners who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you.

We sometimes need to give our service providers who help us run our website and services access to the data we have in order for them to perform those services. They are only authorized to use information that is strictly relevant for them to perform their tasks, and we ensure that they are under obligations of confidentiality to us so that your data is secure. For a full list of third-party service providers used by Ballerina (processors), please visit <a target="_blank" href="/policy/ballerina-subprocessor-list.pdf">Ballerina processor list</a>.

We may share your data with our subsidiaries or affiliates within our corporate group. WSO2 ‘s parent company is WSO2 LLC, which is located in the United States of America. Our affiliates are WSO2 UK Limited (located in the United Kingdom), WSO2 Lanka (Private) Limited (located in Sri Lanka), and WSO2 Brasil Tecnologia E Software Ltd (located in Brazil) and any other affiliates set out in our [Contact us](https://wso2.com/contact/?src=contact) page. We share information within this group because these entities also carry out support, marketing, account management, and technical operations for WSO2 that are relevant to the provision of the website and services.

## Cross-border data transfers

WSO2 operates globally, with businesses both inside and outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") and the UK. We may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than the one in which you live, including transfers to the United States. Additionally, third-party service providers who handle data on our behalf may be based in locations around the world. For these reasons, your personal information may be transferred to other countries both inside and outside of the UK and the EEA. As privacy laws in other countries may not be equivalent to those in your home country, we only make arrangements to transfer data overseas where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect any information held in that country or that the service provider acts at all times in compliance with applicable privacy laws. Where required under applicable laws, we will take measures to ensure that personal information handled in other countries will receive at least the same level of protection as it is given in your home country.

In July 2023, EU regulators approved the United States as a third-party country to which EU personal data may be transferred, under an Adequacy Decision. Subsequent to this, the EU-US Data Privacy Framework was set up (which replaces the previous Privacy Shield Framework). When we transfer personal information to the US, we do so on the following basis:

WSO2 is a participant in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. WSO2 has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the DPF Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/</a>.

Data transferred from the EU, EEA, and the United Kingdom to other WSO2 affiliate entities located around the world is transferred on the basis of Data Transfer Agreements containing the New EU Standard Contractual Clauses set out by the European Commission in June 2021 and their UK equivalent, which guarantee uniform levels of protection to your data as specified by the EU and the UK.

We may also release your information when we believe release is necessary to comply with the law subject to our (Governmental and law enforcement Data Access Policy), enforce our privacy policy, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.

### Dispute resolution

In compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, we commit to resolving complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU/EEA or UK individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our DPF policy should first reach out to us using the information in the [Information about data controllers, processors, and how to contact us](#information-about-data-controllers-processors-and-how-to-contact-us) section below.

WSO2 has committed to refer unresolved DTF complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework">EU-US Data Privacy Framework | JAMS Mediation, Arbitration, ADR Services</a> for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the DTF website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

Within the USA, we are also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

## Security of your data

We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you send us. There is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

## How long do we keep your data?

We may retain your information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection. For instance, we may retain your information during the time in which you have an account to use our website or services. We also may retain your information during the period of time needed for WSO2 to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. At the end of these periods, we ensure that your data is deleted or pseudonymized securely using an industry-standard methodology.

## Your rights to your data and how to manage your preferences

WSO2 acknowledges your right to access your data. If information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to us, then you have the right to access, correct, or edit your data. If you wish, we can provide all the personal information on our records to you or to someone you nominate in a portable format as well.
