Thank you for taking the time to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">responsibly disclose</a> any vulnerabilities you find.

## Report a vulnerability

First of all, make sure that you are using the latest Ballerina version before you run an automated security scan or perform a penetration test against it. All security vulnerabilities and any other concerns related to security should be reported by sending an email to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:security@ballerina.io">security@ballerina.io</a>.  

> **WARNING:** To ensure end-user security, **please do not use any other medium to report security vulnerabilities**. Also, kindly refrain from disclosing the vulnerability details you come across with others, in any forums, sites, or other groups (public or private) before its mitigation and disclosure processes are completed.


If you would like, you can encrypt your report using the  following public key to send secure messages to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:security@ballerina.io">security@ballerina.io</a>:

> security@ballerina.io: AC48 3C56 C0A0 6020 4BBE F3E4 182F 3F21 255F CCE9
