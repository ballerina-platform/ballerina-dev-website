## Reporting a vulnerability

Ensure you are using the latest Ballerina version before you run an automated security scan or perform a penetration test against it.

Based on the ethics of responsible disclosure, you must **only use the [security@ballerina.io](mailto:security@ballerina.io) mailing list** to report security vulnerabilities and any other concerns regarding the security aspects of the source code or any other resource in this repo.

> **WARNING:** To protect the end-user security, **please do not use any other medium to report security vulnerabilities**. Also, kindly refrain from disclosing the vulnerability details you come across with other individuals, in any forums, sites, or other groups - public or private before itâ€™s mitigation actions and disclosure process are completed.

Use the following key to send secure messages to security@ballerina.io:

> security@ballerina.io: 0168 DA26 2989 0DB9 4ACD 8367 E683 061E 2F85 C381 [pgp.mit.edu](https://pgp.surfnet.nl/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&search=0xE683061E2F85C381)

Also, use the following template when reporting vulnerabilities so that it contains all the required information and helps expedite the analysis and mitigation process.
