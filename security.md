# Reporting a Security Vulnerability

The WSO2 security team welcomes contributions from our user community, developers, and security researchers to reinforce our product security. The security team will be more than happy to assist you in such efforts.

We strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: [security@ballerina.io](mailto:security@ballerina.io) - first, before disclosing them in any public forums.

This is a private mailing list where only members of the WSO2 internal security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.

If you wish to send secure messages to [security@ballerina.io](mailto:security@ballerina.io), you may use the following key:

security@ballerina.io: 0168 DA26 2989 0DB9 4ACD  8367 E683 061E 2F85 C381 [pgp.mit.edu](https://pgp.surfnet.nl/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&search=0xE683061E2F85C381)
