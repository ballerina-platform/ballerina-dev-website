# Steps to Create a Compiler Plugin

Creating a compiler plugin typically involves extending the capabilities of an existing compiler by adding custom functionality. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a compiler plugin:

## 1. Choose the Compiler Framework
Select the compiler for which you want to create the plugin. For example:
- **Clang** (LLVM-based) is widely used for C, C++, and other languages.
- **GCC** allows adding plugins to extend its capabilities.
- Other language compilers may also allow plugins (e.g., Rust, Swift).

## 2. Set Up the Development Environment
Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed. For Clang/LLVM:
- Download and install **LLVM**.
- Set up **CMake** for building the plugin.

For **GCC**:
- Install GCC and its plugin development libraries.

Example for Clang:
```bash
sudo apt-get install clang llvm cmake
```

## 3. Understand Plugin Interface
Review the documentation for the specific compiler to understand how plugins are structured. For **Clang**, plugins interact with Clang’s Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and provide custom actions like analyzing, modifying, or emitting code.

## 4. Create the Plugin Source Code
Write the code for your plugin based on the functionality you want to extend or modify. For Clang plugins, you’ll interact with the AST.

Example for a basic Clang plugin:
```cpp
#include "clang/Frontend/FrontendPluginRegistry.h"
#include "clang/AST/ASTConsumer.h"
#include "clang/AST/RecursiveASTVisitor.h"
#include "clang/Frontend/CompilerInstance.h"
#include "clang/Parse/ParseAST.h"

using namespace clang;

class MyASTVisitor : public RecursiveASTVisitor<MyASTVisitor> {
 public:
   bool VisitFunctionDecl(FunctionDecl *f) {
       llvm::outs() << "Found function: " << f->getNameAsString() << "\n";
       return true;
   }
};

class MyASTConsumer : public ASTConsumer {
 public:
   void HandleTranslationUnit(ASTContext &context) override {
       MyASTVisitor Visitor;
       Visitor.TraverseDecl(context.getTranslationUnitDecl());
   }
};

class MyFrontendAction : public PluginASTAction {
 protected:
   std::unique_ptr<ASTConsumer> CreateASTConsumer(CompilerInstance &CI, llvm::StringRef) override {
       return std::make_unique<MyASTConsumer>();
   }

   bool ParseArgs(const CompilerInstance &CI, const std::vector<std::string> &args) override {
       return true;
   }
};

static FrontendPluginRegistry::Add<MyFrontendAction>
X("my-plugin", "My custom plugin");
```

## 5. Build the Plugin
Set up a build system using **CMake** (for Clang) or the appropriate build tool for your compiler.
Create a `CMakeLists.txt` for building the plugin:

Example CMake configuration:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyPlugin)

find_package(LLVM REQUIRED CONFIG)
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${LLVM_CMAKE_DIR}")
include(AddLLVM)

add_clang_library(MyPlugin
  MyPlugin.cpp
  LINK_LIBS clangTooling clangBasic clangAST)
```

Build the plugin:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## 6. Test the Plugin
To test the plugin, pass it to the compiler using appropriate flags:

For Clang:
```bash
clang -cc1 -load ./MyPlugin.so -plugin my-plugin example.cpp
```

For GCC (if creating a GCC plugin):
```bash
gcc -fplugin=./my_plugin.so example.c
```

## 7. Handle Command-Line Arguments
If you need to pass arguments to your plugin, handle them in the `ParseArgs` method.

Example:
```cpp
bool ParseArgs(const CompilerInstance &CI, const std::vector<std::string> &args) override {
   for (const auto &arg : args) {
       llvm::outs() << "Plugin argument: " << arg << "\n";
   }
   return true;
}
```

## 8. Debug and Refine
Debug and refine your plugin by adding additional functionality or analyzing code as needed. Use compiler output and logs for troubleshooting.

## 9. Deploy the Plugin
Once the plugin is stable, package it and share it for use in other projects. You can provide documentation on how to load and use the plugin with relevant compilers.

## 10. Documentation and Support
Write documentation explaining how to use and extend your plugin, including supported compiler versions, build instructions, and usage examples.

## Example Resources:
- **Clang Plugin Documentation:** [Clang Plugins](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangPlugins.html)
- **GCC Plugin Documentation:** [GCC Plugins](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Plugins.html)

## Purpose
This PR adds documentation for creating a compiler plugin, detailing the steps for plugin development, testing, and deployment using common compiler frameworks like Clang and GCC. This addition serves as a resource for developers seeking to extend compiler functionality.

## Changes Made

- **Page addition:** Added new documentation for creating a compiler plugin with detailed steps.
  - `permalink`: Added to ensure accessibility of the new page.

# Page Management Instructions

Here are the detailed instructions for page removal, renaming, and restructuring that you can include in your documentation:

## Page Removal
- **Ensure the entry is removed from the corresponding left navigation YAML file** (if applicable). This prevents broken links in the navigation.
- **Add `redirect_from` on an alternative page for proper redirection.** This allows users to be redirected seamlessly to the new location.
- **If no alternative page exists, add redirection in the `redirections.js` file.** This ensures that users are redirected even if they try to access a removed page directly.

## Page Rename
- **Add front-matter `redirect_from` to handle existing links.** This maintains the accessibility of previously linked content.
- **Add `redirect_to:` front-matter (if applicable) to redirect users to the new location.** This guides users to the updated page seamlessly.

## Page Restructure
- **Add `permalink` to any restructured pages.** This ensures that the new structure remains accessible through a fixed URL.
- **Include `redirect_from` front-matter to manage changes in page structure.** This helps redirect users from old URLs to the new paths effectively.
- **Add `redirect_to:` front-matter (if applicable) to guide users to new pages.** This provides clear navigation for users transitioning to the new structure.
