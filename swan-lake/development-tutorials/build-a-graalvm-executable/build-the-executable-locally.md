---

## Prerequisites

To complete this part of the guide, you need:
1. [Ballerina 2201.7.0 (Swan Lake)](/downloads) or greater
2. A text editor
   >**Tip:** Preferably, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> with the  <a href="https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/" target="_blank">Ballerina extension</a> installed.
3. GraalVM installed and configured appropriately
4. A command terminal

## Configure GraalVM

1. Install GraalVM on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via Git Bash, Cygwin, or WSL) using the following command.

      ```
      $ bash <(curl -sL https://get.graalvm.org/jdk)  graalvm-ce-java11-22.3.0
      ```
      > **Note:** The above command installs the native-image tool, which is required to generate the native images along with GraalVM. Follow the instructions in the output log to resolve prerequisites for GraalVM native image.
      For additional information, see [Get Started with GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/22.3/docs/getting-started).
2. Configure the runtime environment. Set the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to the GraalVM installation directory as directed at the end of the execution of the above command.

> **Note:** 
> - On Windows, the native image requires Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). For instructions on installing Visual Studio Code with the Windows 10 SDK, go to [Using GraalVM and Native Image on Windows 10](https://medium.com/graalvm/using-graalvm-and-native-image-on-windows-10-9954dc071311).
> - The GraalVM native-image tool support for Apple M1 (darwin-aarch64) is still experimental. For more updates, see [Support for Apple M1](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2666).

After the environment is set up, follow the steps below to build a native executable for a simple Ballerina HTTP server application.

## Build the GraalVM executable

1. Execute the command below to create a Ballerina service package.
   ```
   $ bal new hello_world -t service
   ```

2. Replace the content of the `service.bal` file with the following.
   ```ballerina
   import ballerina/http;

   service / on new http:Listener(8080) {
       resource function get greeting() returns string {   
              return "Hello, World!";   
       }
   }
   ```

3. Run `bal build --graalvm` to create the GraalVM executable.
   ```
   $ bal build --graalvm

   ```

   > **Note:** On Windows, the Microsoft Native Tools for Visual Studio must be initialized before building a native image. You can do this by starting the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt** that was installed with the Visual Studio Build Tools. In the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt, navigate to your project folder and run `bal build --native`.

4. Execute the command below to run the native executable.
   ```
   $ ./target/bin/hello_world
   ```

5. Test the service with a cURL request.
   ```
   $ curl http://localhost:8080/greeting
   Hello, World!
   ```

Now, you have built and tested a native executable locally for a simple Ballerina HTTP server application. 

## Evaluate GraalVM compatibility

It is recommended to use the JVM for verifying the functionality of the application with sufficient tests and code coverage as running tests against the GraalVM native image could take time. Running tests against the native image is only required when you see GraalVM incompatibility warnings during `bal build --graalvm`. 

```
*********************************************************************************
* WARNING: Some dependencies may not be GraalVM compatible.                     *
*********************************************************************************

The following Ballerina dependencies in your project could pose compatibility
issues with GraalVM. 

Packages pending compatibility verification with GraalVM:

- PackageA
- PackageB
- PackageC

Packages marked as incompatible with GraalVM:

- PackageA
- PackageB
- PackageC

Please note that generating a GraalVM native image may fail or result in runtime
issues if these packages rely on features that are not supported by GraalVM's
native image generation process.

It is recommended to review the API documentation or contact the maintainers of
these packages for more information on their GraalVM compatibility status. You
may need to adjust or find alternatives for these packages before proceeding
with GraalVM native image generation.

*********************************************************************************
```

If the application depends on a package that is not verified against the GraalVM native image build, it is recommended to run the tests against the native image by executing the `bal test --graalvm` command to ensure that there are no runtime issues.

Also, GraalVM native testing can be scheduled as a daily check within CI(Continuous Integration) pipelines to maintain compatibility with GraalVM.

Follow the steps below to run the tests with the native image.


1. Follow steps 1 and 2 in [Build the GraalVM executable](#build-the-graalvm-executable).

2. Replace the content of the `service_test.bal` file with the following under the `tests` folder.  
   ```ballerina
   import ballerina/http;
   import ballerina/test;

   http:Client testClient = check new ("http://localhost:8080");

   @test:Config {}
   function testServiceWithProperName() {
      string|error response = testClient->get("/greeting");
      test:assertEquals(response, "Hello, World!");
   }
   ```

3.  Run `bal test --graalvm` to run the tests using the GraalVM executable. 
      > **Info:**  This command will build a native executable with tests similar to `bal build --graalvm`, and the tests will be executed by running this native executable.
      ```
               Running Tests
               hello_world
                        [pass] testServiceWithProperName
                        1 passing
                        0 failing
                        0 skipped
      ```

Now, you tested a simple Ballerina HTTP server application for GraalVM compatibility.

> **Note:** Code coverage  and runtime debug features are not supported with GraalVM native image testing. 

## Create GraalVM-compatible library packages

Packages that solely use Ballerina standard libraries and connectors or those that use platform Java libraries provided by the distribution are inferred to be compatible with GraalVM.

If the package utilizes any Java platform libraries specified in the `Ballerina.toml`, it falls upon the package author to ensure that it remains compatible with GraalVM even after incorporating these platform dependencies. In the event that GraalVM compatibility has not been confirmed by the user, the bal pack command will trigger a warning message.

```
**********************************************************************************
* WARNING: Package is not verified with GraalVM.                                 *
**********************************************************************************

The GraalVM compatibility property has not been defined for the package
'<package-name>. This could potentially lead to compatibility issues with GraalVM.

To resolve this warning, please ensure that all Java dependencies of this
package are compatible with GraalVM. Subsequently, update the Ballerina.toml
file under the section '[platform.<java*>]' with the attribute
'graalvmCompatible = true'.

**********************************************************************************
```

In that scenario, the package owner should evaluate the GraalVM-compatibility with `bal test --graalvm`. If the package has sufficient test cases to verify the compatibility, the package can be marked as GraalVM-compatible by adding the following to the Ballerin.toml file.
```toml
[platform.java11]
graalvmCompatible = true
```
