## Use the Ballerina tool

The Ballerina Tool is a command-line tool for managing Ballerina source code. It helps you to manage Ballerina packages and modules, test, build, and run programs, etc.

It also enables you to easily install, update, and switch among Ballerina distributions. 

In the CLI, execute the `bal help` command to view all the actions you can perform with the Ballerina Tool as shown below.

```

NAME
       ballerina-pull - Fetch packages from Ballerina Central

SYNOPSIS
       bal pull <org-name>/<package-name>[:<version>]


DESCRIPTION
       Download the specified package from Ballerina Central along with its
       dependencies and cache it in the '.ballerina' directory in the user home.

       Ballerina Central is a package repository hosted at
       https://central.ballerina.io/. A package repository organizes packages
       into a three-level hierarchy: organization, package name, and version.
       Organizations are unique within a repository and can be mapped to an
       individual user or organization registered with the repository.


EXAMPLES
       Pull the latest version of the 'gmail' connector in the 'wso2' organization
       from Ballerina Central.
           $ bal pull wso2/gmail

       Pull the '1.1.0' version of the 'gmail' connector in the 'wso2' organization
       from Ballerina Central.
           $ bal pull wso2/gmail:1.1.0
```
