## Introduction 
When deploying Ballerina applications in production, you can choose from several deployment types depending on your needs.
Each option balances flexibility, control, and operational overhead based on your specific deployment types:

1. Virtual Machines or Bare Metal: Provides full control over the infrastructure, making it suitable for high-performance or legacy systems requiring custom configurations or direct hardware access.
2. Kubernetes/Docker: Ideal for containerized, cloud-native microservices, offering scalability and orchestration with Ballerinaâ€™s built-in support for Kubernetes and Docker artifacts.
3. Serverless: Suitable for event-driven, cost-critical applications, where cloud providers manage the infrastructure, such as AWS Lambda.
