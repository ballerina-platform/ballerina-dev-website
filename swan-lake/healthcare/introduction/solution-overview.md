intro: The WSO2 Healthcare solution is an open-source integration platform built on top of the best in its industry. 
---

The platform allows you to connect to other heterogenous systems (e.g., EHRs/EMRs, insurance claims management systems, databases, etc.), by transforming your data to/from healthcare message formats (e.g., FHIR, HL7, X12, C-CDA etc.) and exposing them through secure APIs.

The primary objective of the solution is to facilitate healthcare providers and other related stakeholders of the domain with the required interoperability to standardize the connectivity of their IT systems through an auto generative, easily extensible, and well supported set of healthcare accelerators.

Following are the key offerings provided through the WSO2 Healthcare Platform.

## Structures and standardizes data for better interoperability

Expose healthcare records over FHIR® APIs and build an FHIR® R4 server on top of an open-source hybrid API management platform. Supports future FHIR versions easily through a well-designed architecture of the solution.

## Privacy and security

OpenID connect and end-user-claim based privacy controls are utilized on health data. The SMART-on-FHIR specification is supported and enriched with latest advancements in the security domain such as multifactor authentication, adaptive authentication (i.e. authentication flows can be changed based on the attributes of the users).

## Third-party access management

Application developers can self register and gain access to FHIR® APIs over OAuth 2.0. This enables them to search and discover all available APIs, read documentation, try them out—all through one portal, and approve workflows. Further, consent management features are also supported to onboard third parties securely.

## Consent requests management

Customizable, robust, out-of-the-box consent management functionality that enables simple deployment of patient friendly consent requests that meet the mandated FHIR compliance requirements, provides secure third-party access, future proofs your interoperability strategy, and more.

## Integration and data transformation

Easily integrate wearable devices (through standard protocols such as WebSockets), EMR/EHR systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner, Athena Health and any system that exposes a REST API or an FHIR API), HTTP/ WebSockets/ GraphQL services, databases, and many more. It also transforms data to FHIR® using prebuilt FHIR® accelerators. The platform's comprehensive tooling supports building, debugging, testing, and packaging your integrations.

## Real-time insights

Generates rapid, insightful data-driven decisions by analyzing the traffic through the platform in near real-time.

## API marketplace

Establish a transparent healthcare exchange to bring people, processes, and technology together. Expand your API visibility and increase your interoperability score.

## Deploy anywhere

The solution is not tied to any cloud platform. Therefore, it brings the ability to deploy on any environment such as on-premises, multi-cloud, hybrid infrastructure, bare metal machines, VMs, containers, etc.
