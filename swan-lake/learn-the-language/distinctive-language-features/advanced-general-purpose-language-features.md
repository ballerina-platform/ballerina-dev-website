intro: Let's now look at the other features of the Ballerina language. These are a mixed bag of additional options to the language, making everything fit together to build a Ballerina application.
---

## Default values for function parameters

Ballerina allows specifying default values for function parameters. You can use any expression such as a literal or a function call as the default value of a parameter. Additionally, the default value expressions can use the values of preceding parameters.

```ballerina
function substring(string str, int 'start = 0, int end = str.length()) 
            returns int? {
    // ...
}
```

The type descriptor contains closures for every defaultable parameter. These closures accept the values specified for the previous parameters as arguments. Using those closures, the compiler generates code to fill missing values at the call site for this function. This is not part of the function type and is not applicable when functions are passed around as a first-class value.

## Provide function arguments by name

In addition to default values for parameters, it is also useful to call functions with named arguments. Ballerina allows you to call functions with named arguments, and these named arguments do not have to be in the same order as the parameters.

Consider the function below.

```ballerina
function foo(int x, int y, int z) {
    
}
```

This function can be called in any of the following ways:

```ballerina
foo(1, 2, 3);
foo(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3);
foo(z = 3, y = 2, x = 1);
foo(1, z = 3, y = 2);
```

The first statement calls the function in the usual way without using the names of the arguments. The second and third statements use named arguments in an order different from that of the parameters of the function definition. The Ballerina compiler transforms them into positional arguments. The argument list of a function is described by a tuple type, and names are not part of that type. You can also combine the named arguments with positional arguments, as shown in the fourth option, given that they are specified after the positional arguments.

You have to pay special attention to argument names of remote methods and resource methods since these names are exposed as public interfaces for API endpoints. This is also applicable for public functions in a module. Changing the argument names of such functions makes the module incompatible when it is imported into other modules.

## Type inclusion for records

There are times when it is beneficial to create a record by combining fields of other records. For example, suppose you have a **``Date``** record, which has ``year``, ``month``, and ``day`` fields and you also have a **``TimeOfDay``** record having ``hour``, ``minute``, and ``seconds`` fields. 

You can create a **``Time``** record that has all the fields of ``Date`` and ``TimeOfDay``, using the ``*T`` notation.

```ballerina
type Date record {
    int year;
    int month;
    int day;
};

type TimeOfDay record {
    int hour;
    int minute;
    decimal seconds;
};

type Time record {
    *Date;
    *TimeOfDay;
};
```
   
Using the **``*T``** notation, you can include the record type **``T``** in the record type descriptor of another record. This is effectively the same as copying the fields of the included records, **``Date``** and **``TimeOfDay``**, into the including record, **``Time``**.

## Included record parameters

While designing API interfaces in Ballerina, you invoke the function with named arguments. Alternatively, you can also pass all the arguments within a record value. In this case, the mapping constructor is used as part of function invocation.

Ballerina allows you to define functions with included record parameters. In this case, the function defines records for named parameters. But the caller can pass parameters by name, which are the same as the record field names.  The ``*T`` notation can be used for this purpose.

```ballerina
type Options record {|
    boolean verbose = false;
    string? outputFile = ();
|};

function foo(string inputFile, *Options options) { 
}   

public function main() {
    foo("file.txt", verbose = true);
}
```

The function **``foo()``** has a ``string`` parameter **``inputFile``** and an included record parameter of the **``Options``** record type. So apart from calling this function by directly passing a value of the **``Options``** record type, you can also pass named arguments having the same names as the fields in the **``Options``** record.

This way of including record fields as named arguments in a function provides a consistent experience to the caller.

## Default values for record fields

Ballerina also allows default values for record fields as part of the record's type descriptor. A default value is an expression, which can also be a closure computed in the context of the enclosing module scope.

```ballerina
type X record {
    string str = "";
};

X x = {};
```
  
In the above code example, the record **``X``** has a field **``str``** which is defaulted to empty string. Since the variable **``x``** of type **``X``** is initialized without specifying a value for the ``str`` field, the constructed ``X`` value will use the default empty string value for the ``str`` field.

Default values do not affect static typing. They only affect the use of type descriptors to construct records. Calling the ``value:cloneWithType()`` function with a record type-descriptor **``T``** will make use of default values in **``T``** if required. Similarly, using **``*T``** also copies the default values.

## Object types

Ballerina also allows you to define object types that define just the type without the implementation. Unlike classes, which give you the type as well as the implementation that you can instantiate through ``new``, an object type is a definition without any implementation. It is similar to an interface, as defined in the Java programming language.

```ballerina
type Hashable object {
    function hash() returns int;
};

function h() returns Hashable {
    var obj = object {
        function hash() returns int {
            return 42;
        }
    };
    return obj;
}
```

In the above code example, **``Hashable``** is an object type, and it has a method called **``hash( )``**  that returns an integer. The function **``h()``** returns the object type **``Hashable``**. Inside **``h()``**, an object of type **``Hashabe``** is created by defining the **``hash()``** method and assigned to the **``obj``** variable, which is finally returned.

Object typing is structural, and an object type looks like a pattern that the object must match. In this case, the match is done to check that the returned object matches the pattern of the **``Hashable``** object type which contains a **``hash()``** method returning an integer.

## Object type inclusion

You can also include object types using the **``*T``** syntax. You have two options for that. First, you can include an object type in another object type, such that one interface extends another interface. Secondly, you can also have a class that includes a type, like the class implementing the interface.

```ballerina
type Cloneable object {
    function clone() returns Cloneable;
};

type Shape object {
    *Cloneable;
    
    function draw();
};

class Circle {
    *Shape;

    function clone() returns Circle {
        return new;
    }

    function draw() {
    }
}
```

In the above code example, **``Cloneable``** is an object type. It is included as part of the interface for the **``Shape``** object type. Therefore **``Shape``** defines an interface containing the function **``draw()``** which is part of its own type as well as the function **``clone()``** included from the **``Cloneable``** type. The class **``Circle``** includes the **``Shape``** object type. Therefore it has to implement both the **``clone()``** and **``draw()``** methods. The function **``clone( )``** returns a **``Circle``** and is considered valid since the **``Circle``** type becomes a subtype of **``Cloneable``** type once it includes the **``Cloneable``** object type.  

The implementation of the object type within the class that includes the type is checked at the compile time. This provides interface inheritance. Ballerina does not support implementation inheritance.

## Distinct object types

Ballerina also supports the concept of ``distinct`` object types. This concept allows you to define a type with a name that is significant, similar to nominal typing, within a structured type system. It is done using the ``distinct`` keyword in the type definition.

```ballerina
type Person distinct object {
    public string name;
};

distinct class Employee {
    *Person;
    
    function init(string name) {
        self.name = name;
    }
}

distinct class Manager {
    *Person;
    
    function init(string name) {
        self.name = name;
    }
}
```

In the above code example, the **``Person``** type is defined as ``distinct``. This means that the compiler will give this type a unique name, with which the object value will be tagged and is unique across all the distinct types defined in the program. The **``Employee``** type includes the **``Person``** type, so it belongs to the distinct **``Person``** type and the distinct **``Employee``** type. Similarly, the **``Manager``** class also inherits the **``Person``** type.

Conceptually, a distinct type including another distinct type results in multiple interface inheritance. So a type check on the value of the **``Employee``** object will return true both for the **``Employee``** as well as the **``Person``**. The same applies to **``Manager``** type.

One scenario where you would want to use a distinct object type is when you are inter-operating with another program in a different programming language, where you want to have distinct types corresponding to the type structures in the other language. For example, if you are interoperating with Java, you want each of the Ballerina classes to correspond to the Java class to capture the Java semantics correctly. Similarly, while interacting with the external world through API interfaces like GraphQL, you may want to leverage nominal typing via this distinct typing feature of Ballerina.


## Read-only objects and classes

You can also define read-only objects and classes. An object is ``readonly`` if all of its fields are ``final`` and are of types that are subtypes of the ``readonly`` type. You can use **``readonly & T``** to declare an object ``T`` as ``readonly``.

```ballerina
type TimeZone readonly & object {
    function getOffset(decimal utc) returns decimal;
};
```

You can also have a class that belongs to the ``readonly`` type by prefixing the ``readonly`` keyword in the class declaration.

```ballerina
readonly class FixedTimeZone {
    *TimeZone;

    final decimal offset;

    function init(decimal offset) {
        self.offset = offset;
    }

    function getOffset(decimal utc) returns decimal {
        return self.offset;
    }
}
```

In the above code example, the **``FixedTimeZone``** class is of the ``readonly`` type. It includes the **``Timezone``** type which is also a ``readonly`` type, and it has a ``final`` ``decimal`` field named **``offset``**. If the class declaration uses ``readonly`` then the object type defined by the class is ``readonly & T``, where ``T`` is the type defined in the class body.

## Error detail

In Ballerina, you can associate additional fields with an error type to include more specific details about the context of the error.

```ballerina
error err = error("Whoops", httpCode = 27);

type HttpDetail record {
    int httpCode;
};

error<HttpDetail> httpError = error("Whoops", httpCode = 27);

HttpDetail d = httpError.detail();
```

In the above code example, **``err``** is an error type constructed from named arguments to add some details to the error value. You can also describe the error details as a type **``T``** by using the **``error<T>``** syntax. The **``HttpDetail``** type is a record type that defines the field **``httpCode``** of type ``int``. When included in the declaration of the **``error<HttpDetail>``** error type, it uses the **``HttpDetail``** record type as the error detail record. When you want to get the detail out of the error, you can use the lang library function ``error:detail()`` to get the detail value of the **``HttpDetail``** record type.

## Error cause

You can also have a cause in an error value. You can pass it as a positional argument to the error constructor. The cause argument is optional in the error constructor.

```ballerina
function foo(string s) returns error|int {
    var res = int:fromString(s);
    if res is error {
        return error("not an integer", res);
    } else {
        return res;
    }
}
```

In the above code example, the error constructor is called with the additional argument **``res``**, which is the error returned in case the **``int:fromString()``** function returns an error.

You can also call the lang library function **``error:cause()``** on an error to extract the cause.

## Type intersection for error types

If you want to have an error type that is both distinct and has a constraint, you can use Ballerina's type intersection to define such an error type.

```ballerina
type IoError distinct error;

type FileErrorDetail record {
    string filename;
};

type FileIoError IoError & error<FileErrorDetail>;
```
 
In the above code example, the **``FileIoError``** error type is declared using a type intersection of the distinct error type **``IoError``** and an error type with the **``FileErrorDetail``** type as the detail type, using the ``&`` notation.

## Type intersection

Type intersection is a generic feature that can be used with other types also. For example, you can use it to combine two objects.

```ballerina
type Foo object {
    function foo();
};

type Bar object {
    function bar();
};

type FooBar Foo & Bar;

// Same as
type FooBar object {
    *Foo;
    *Bar;
};
```

In the above code example, **``Foo``** and **``Bar``** are two separate object types. The **``FooBar``** type is defined using the type intersection of **``Foo``** and **``Bar``** using the ``&`` notation. This has the same result as including the types using the ``*`` notation. It provides a neat alternative to type inclusion but is less flexible.

## Expression-oriented style

Ballerina's general philosophy is to make the programming syntax familiar to those familiar with the C-family of languages. It has a distinction between statements and expressions, just like in C. This is the imperative style of programming which is considered less intuitive. That's why there is a shift towards a functional style of programming that is more expression-oriented.

Ballerina tries to provide a few options to make it possible to do more things with expressions. You have already seen a few examples of expressions, such as query expressions, constructor expressions for structured types, and nil expressions for functions returning nil values.

Here, are a few more things that you can do using expressions in Ballerina.

```ballerina
function inc(int x) returns int => x + 1;

// Same as
function inc(int x) returns int {
    return x + 1;
}
```

You can define the return value expression using the ``=>`` notation instead of using curly braces to define the function body block.

```ballerina
var obj = object {
    private int x = 1;

    function getX() returns int => self.x;
};
```

This works even within objects where methods are implemented.

```ballerina
// Let expressions.
function hypot(float x) returns float =>
    let float x2 = x * x in
        float:sqrt(x2 + x2);
```

And it also works with query statements where you can have expressions following the ``let`` clause using the ``in`` clause.

## Computed field key

Ballerina allows you to have computed values for the names of keys in a map. So, rather than defining it at compile-time, you can compute and use it at runtime.

```ballerina
const X = "x";
const Y = "y";

map<int> m = {
    [X] : 1,
    [Y] : 2
};
```

In the above code example, **``m``** is a map whose constructor defines two keys, substituted from the constants **``X``** and **``Y``** using the square brackets. Similarly, you can use any expression within the square brackets to compute the field name.

This is useful when you have a complex or a long key name, like an URL, which you can assign to a constant and then use that as the key name.

## Tuples

The tuple type is another structured type supported by Ballerina, which creates a list of values like arrays. The main difference between arrays and tuples is that an array has only one type applicable to every member of its list. In contrast, in a tuple type, you can individually specify the types for each member.

```ballerina
// Fixed length array
type FloatPair float[2];

FloatPair p = [1.0, 2.0];
```
  
In the above code example, the **``FloatPair``** type is declared as an array of floats with a fixed length of two.

```ballerina
// Tuple
type FloatPair [float, float];
```

You can create the same list type of two floats as a tuple type by specifying the ``float`` type twice within the square brackets of the tuple declaration, as declared in the  **``FloatPair``** type above.

```ballerina
// Can mix types
type Id [string, int, int];
```

But tuples are most suitable for describing lists with multiple types. In the above code example,  **``Id``** is a tuple type that contains a list whose first member is the ``string`` type and the second and third members are the ``int`` type.

```ballerina
byte[*] a = [104, 101, 108, 108, 111];
```

You can also infer the length of an array from the initializer expression. In the above code example, the array **``a``** is initialized with a fixed length, but the declaration uses a ``*`` notation instead of specifying the length. This means that the compiler will allocate the array length based on the values used as the initializer expression.

## Destructure tuples

Tuples can be accessed normally, like arrays, by specifying the index. However, there is a more intuitive way to use tuples by destructuring them.

```ballerina
type Time [int, decimal];

function toSeconds(Time ip)
    returns decimal {
        var [day, seconds] = ip;
        decimal s = 86400d*<decimal>day;
        s += seconds;
        return s;
}
```

In the above code example, the **``Time``** type is a tuple type. It represents a time in days and seconds as an integer and a decimal value respectively. The **``toSeconds()``** function accepts a variable of type ``Time`` and converts it to seconds in ``decimal``. Within the conversion logic, the tuple value is destructured into two variables: **``day``** and **``seconds``** using a binding pattern with variables initialized from the tuple. This way, you can break down the list of values into individual variables to be used for computation.

With this approach, you can read tuple values in a more idiomatic way within the code, instead of using index-based access.

## Binding patterns in assignment

The destructuring syntax of tuples can also be used to bind to variables in assignments.

```ballerina
int x = 0;
int y = 1;

type IntPair [int, int];

function assign(IntPair ip) {
    [x, y] = ip;
}

function swapXY() {
    [x, y] = [y, x];
}
```

In the above code example, the **``IntPair``** type is a tuple type of two members of type ``int``. Within the function **``assign()``**, the variable **``ip``** of type  **``IntPair``** is destructured and assigned to the two module-level variables **``x``** and **``y``**.  This makes it very efficient to perform some operations, such as swapping two variables. In the function **``swapXY()``** you can see that the swapping is done between **``x``** and **``y``** just by doing tuple destructuring without using a temporary variable.

## Rest type in tuples

Similar to how maps can be described as record types, arrays can also be defined as tuple types using the ``...`` syntax.

```ballerina
// int followed by
// zero or more strings
type Id [int, string...];
```

In the above code example, the tuple type **``Id``** has the first member of the list as integer, followed by any number of members of type ``string``. This is known as the tuple rest descriptor.

Therefore, any array of type ``T``, as in ``T[]``, can be described as ``[T...]``, which is a tuple containing zero or more members of type ``T`` in the list. Tuples are not open by default.

## Array/map symmetry

| Basic<br>type | Index type | JSON   | Constructor                       | Type with<br>uniform<br>member<br>type | Type with<br>per-index member<br>type       | Open type                            |
|---------------|------------|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| list          | int        | array  | [<br> "foo",<br> "bar"<br>]       | array<br><br>T[]                       | tuple<br><br>[T0,T1]                        | <br>[T0,Tr...]                       |
| mapping       | string     | object | {<br> x: "foo",<br> y: "bar"<br>} | map<br><br>map&lt;T&gt;                     | record<br><br>record {<br> Tx x; Ty y;<br>} | record {\|<br> Tx x;<br> Tr...;<br>\|} |

Overall, Ballerina provides quite a nice symmetry between lists and mappings.  

If you consider the two types of values, lists and mappings lists are indexed by integers, and mappings are indexed by strings. In terms of the JSON format, lists are represented by arrays, and mappings are represented by objects. The constructor for lists uses square brackets and the constructor for mappings uses curly brackets.

Both list and mappings types can be described in two ways, using uniform member types, and per-index member types. A list with uniform member type ``T`` is an array, declared as ``T[]``. A mapping with uniform type member ``T`` is a map, declared as ``map<T>``. Similarly, a list with per-index member types ``T0`` and ``T1`` is a tuple, declared as ``[T0, T1]``. And a mapping with per-index member types is a record, declared as ``record { Tx x; Ty  y; }``.

Using the ``...`` notation you can have an open type. In the case of lists, an open type is declared as a tuple type as ``[T0, Tr...]``. In the case of mappings, it is a record type declared as ``record {| Tx x; Tr ...; |}``.

## Rest parameters

Ballerina also supports rest parameters.

```ballerina
function foo(int n, string... s) {
}

function bar() {
    // Param `s` will be ["x", "y", "z"].
    foo(1, "x", "y", "z");
}
```

In the above code example, the function **``foo()``** has an integer parameter followed by **``string...``** which is the rest parameter. Therefore when this function is called, it takes one integer value, followed by any number of string values. All of the string parameters get bound into a list which will be the value of **``s``**. In this example, when function **``foo()``** is called within function **``bar()``** with three string parameters, all of them will get bound up in a list of three strings and be passed to the function **``foo()``** as parameter **``s``**.

This feature is also useful in service resource methods whose parameters are mapped to API paths.

```ballerina
service on hl {
    // With URL file/x/y/z
    // `path` will be ["x", "y", "z"].
    resource function get file/[string... path]()
            returns string|error {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the above code example, the service has a resource method which is **``file/``**. It has a string rest parameter. As a result, you can append any number of levels to the base path **``file/``** to represent a URL denoting a complete file path.

## Spread operator ``...x``

The spread operator ``...x``  allows you to spread out the members of a structured type. If you declare **``...x``**, where ``x`` is a list or mapping, this is equivalent to specifying each member of ``x`` separated by a comma. In the case of lists, it is specified by positions, and in the case of mappings, it is specified by name.

```ballerina
type Date record {|
    int year;
    int month;
    int day;
|};

type TimeOfDay record {|
    int hour;
    int minute;
    int second;
|};

type DateTime record {|
    *Date;
    *TimeOfDay;
|};

function merge(Date d, TimeOfDay t) returns DateTime {
    return {...d, ...t};
}
```

In the above code example, **``Date``** and **``TimeofDay``** types are closed record types that are included in the **``DateTime``** record. The function **``merge()``** returns a value of type **``DateTime``** which is constructed using the spread operator with the arguments of type **``Date``** and **``TimeofDay``**, which is equivalent to specifying each individual field from the two arguments explicitly.

Spreading also works in the case of function calls, by calling ``f(...x)``, which expands ``x`` into function arguments. If **``x``** is a list, the arguments are arranged positionally, else, in the case of a mapping, they are arranged as named arguments. You can use spreading in a list constructor as ``[...x]`` or in a mapping constructor as ``{...x}``. You can also use it in an error constructor as ``error(msg, ...x)``, in which case ``x`` must be a mapping.

The basic rule to allow the spread operator is that the static type of the expression guarantees type safety with each value. For example, if the **``Date``** and **``TimeofDay``** are open records, containing the same name for a member, then at the time of spreading to construct the record **``DateTime``**, this will lead to a duplication of fields. Therefore, this will not be allowed at compile-time.

## Spread in binding patterns

You can use the spread operator in binding patterns.

```ballerina
import ballerina/io;

type Id [int, string...];

function process(Id id) {
    var [n, ...path] = id;
    foreach string s in path {
        io:println(s);
    }
}
```

In the above code example, **``Id``** is a type with ``string`` as the rest type. Inside the function **``process()``**, it is destructured using a binding pattern that uses the spread operator, such that the variable **``path``** will contain all the string values passed within the tuple type. This can be leveraged with records too.

## Binding patterns in ``match`` statements

You can also use the spread operator in a binding pattern in a match statement. For example, it can be used with an open record in a ``match`` statement.

```ballerina
import ballerina/io;

type Pair record {
    int x;
    int y;
};

function foo(Pair pair) {
    match pair {
        var {x, y, ...rest} => {
            io:println(x, ", ", y, ", ", rest);
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code example, the ``match`` statement has a binding pattern that matches the variables **``x``** and **``y``** to the `x` and `y` fields of the record ``pair``. The binding pattern also has a rest binding pattern to capture the additional fields that may be defined in ``pair``, since it is an open record. The record value ``pair`` will be matched to this since it has the fields `x` and `y`, and the variable ``rest`` will be bound to everything else in ``pair``.

The type for ``rest`` can be interpreted as a map of ``anydata``. But when it is included in the binding pattern that includes the fields ``x`` and ``y`` from ``Pair``, we know that the type of ``rest`` should be defined in such a way that it must not contain the fields ``x`` and ``y`` itself. This is achieved through another kind of type called the ``never`` type, which is covered in the next section.

## ``never`` type

Ballerina also supports a ``never`` type which means that no value belongs to the type. This is useful on quite a few occasions. One simple way to leverage the ``never`` type is to use it as a return type for a function that never returns normally.

```ballerina
function whoops() returns never {
    panic error("whoops");
}
```

In the above code example, the function **``whoops()``** always panics. It never returns normally. Therefore, it is perfectly fine to describe the return type of this function as ``never``.

A variable cannot be of the ``never`` type. However, you can use it with streams and ``xml``. **``stream<int, never>``** means that it is an infinite stream. **``xml<never>``** means that it is an empty sequence, and can be used to define the type for an empty XML sequence.

One of the interesting ways of leveraging the ``never`` type in records is to use it to set constraints on the fields it may contain.

```ballerina
type Pair record {
    int x;
    int y;
};

Pair p = {
    x: 1,
    y: 2,
    "color": "blue"
};

var {x: _, y: _, ...rest} = p;

// Type of `rest` is
type PairRest record {
    never x?;
    never y?;
};
```

In the above code example, **``Pair``** is an open record. Therefore, **``p``** is constructed with the fields **``x``**, **``y``**, and an additional field **``color``**.  You can use a binding pattern to define a variable **``rest``**, which contains fields other than **``x``** and **``y``**. That makes **``rest``** a type of map with the key ``"color"`` and the value ``"blue"``. The type for **``rest``** is defined as **``PairRest``**, which is a record with two optional fields **``x``** and **``y``** of the ``never`` type. However, as you cannot have variables with the ``never`` type, the net result is that you cannot have these fields in the record. Thus, ``record { never x?; never y?; }`` means that it can have any field of the type ``anydata``, except fields with keys ``x`` and ``y``.

This means that **``rest``** can have any field except the fields with keys `x` and `y` since they are already bound. The ``never`` type can be leveraged with optional fields to indicate that a record will never have that particular field.

## Interface to external code

Sometimes you want to interface with external code. Instead of implementing the function body the keyword ``external`` can be used. The implementation figures out how to map to the external implementation.

```ballerina
public function open(string path)
        returns handle|error = external;
```

In the above code example, the **``open()``** function has an external implementation since its body is defined as **``= external``**. The ``external`` keyword can be annotated to add additional information that specifies where the implementation comes from.

As part of interfacing with an external implementation, Ballerina supports another basic type called ``handle``. A ``handle`` value is a reference to storage managed externally and it may be passed as a reference to an external function like in the **JVM** where you may have a Java object reference pointing to the implementation.

The ``handle`` type is basically an opaque handle that can be passed to external functions. There is no typing for ``handle`` and it can be added as a private member of a Ballerina class for better type safety. Alternatively, you can also have an entire module that is implemented in something other than Ballerina.

## Built-in integer subtypes

Another feature that is particularly useful when interacting with external code is the concept of built-in subtypes. Ballerina only has one integer type which is a 64-bit, signed type. But the external code may use different variants of integers, and you need to support those types. The ``lang.int`` lang library provides these variants as subtypes.

```ballerina
function srand(int:Unsigned32 seed) = external;

function demo(int n) {
    // OK: 72 is an int:Unsigned32
    srand(72);
    // use lo bits
    srand(n & 0xFFFFFFFF);
    // panic if out of range
    srand(<int:Unsigned32>n);
}
```

In the above code example, the function **``srand()``** takes a parameter **``seed``** which is of type ``int:Unsigned32``.  You can then call this function by passing a valid unsigned, 32-bit number. Bitwise operations on this subtype have to have special typing based on logic operators. You can also cast to it from another variable, but the code will panic if the integer value contained in that variable is out of range.

Similarly, the ``lang.int`` lang library provides the ``int:Signed32``, ``int:Signed16``, and ``int:Signed8`` subtypes, as well as ``int:Unsigned16`` and ``int:Unsigned8`` (same as ``byte``).

One important thing to remember about these subtypes is that these are not separate basic types. Operations on these subtypes work exactly like integers. These subtypes allow better optimization of storage, particularly for arrays.

## Built-in string subtype

Similar to integer subtypes, the ``lang.string`` lang library also supports a ``Char`` type which is a subtype of ``string``. In Ballerina a single character is defined as a string of length one, but you can still use the subtype ``string:Char``.

```ballerina
string:Char ch = "x";
int cp = ch.toCodePointInt();
```

In the above code example, **``ch``** is of the ``string:Char`` type. You can also extract the code point of the character by calling the **``toCodePointInt()``** function. This ``string:Char`` subtype is analogous to the XML subtypes like XML elements or text.

## Regular Expressions

Ballerina provides first-class support for regular expressions, represented by the built-in ``RegExp`` type defined in the ``lang.regexp`` module. Additionally, the ``lang.string`` module has a type alias named the same which allows you to use either ``regexp:RegExp`` or  ``string:RegExp`` to define variables for regular expressions.

Ballerina regular expressions are based on the ECMAScript 2022 specification, with support for a subset of ECMAScript syntax. You can refer to the [Ballerina regular expression specification](https://ballerina.io/spec/lang/master/#section_10.1) to find the supported syntax.

There are two ways to declare regular expressions:

1. Using regular expression template expression:

    ```ballerina
    string:RegExp reg = re `abc+`;
    ```

    In this approach, you specify the pattern between two backticks, followed by  ``re`` keyword to define a regular expression using a template literal. This allows for easy expression of regular expressions in a way that is similar to other languages.

2. Using the ``fromString`` function from the ``lang.regexp`` module:

    ```ballerina
    import ballerina/lang.regexp;

    string quantiferStr = "{2,3}";
    string stringPattern = string `abc${quantiferStr}`;
    string:RegExp reg = check regexp:fromString(stringPattern);
    ```

    This approach allows for more dynamic construction of regular expressions using string manipulation techniques to create a pattern that can be compiled into a ``RegExp`` value.

The template expression approach results in the compilation of the regular expression at compile-time, while the ``fromString`` function results in runtime compilation.

Regular expression templates support interpolation, which allows you to dynamically insert values into a regular expression pattern at specific sub-syntax contexts defined by the regular expression grammar.

For example:

In the example below, the regular expression pattern includes the `name` parameter interpolated into the pattern. This allows for dynamic patterns that can change based on the input.

```ballerina
function createPattern(string name) {
    string:RegExp pattern = re `[a-z]{3}|${name}`;
}
```

### Unicode property escape

Unicode property escapes allow matching characters based on their Unicode properties. For instance, Unicode property escapes can be used to match emojis, punctuations, letters from specific languages or scripts, etc. 

```ballerina
// `\p` will match the property value.
string:RegExp lowerCaseLetter = re `\p{Ll}`;

// `\P` will match the negation of the property value.
string:RegExp nonDigitChar = re `\P{N}`;

// It is not mandatory to use the property name(`gc`) for General categories.
string:RegExp punctuation = re `\p{gc=P}`;

// Using `sc` to specify the Script property.
string:RegExp latin = re `\p{sc=Latin}`;
```

### Non-capturing groups

Ballerina regex supports non-capturing groups and flags to control the behavior of regular expression patterns. These allow you to group a set of regular expression constructs without capturing the matched text.

```ballerina
string:RegExp nonCapturingGrpPattern = re `(?im-s:hello.+world)`;
```

In the above example, a non-capturing group pattern have multiple flags inside the parentheses. The ``i`` flag makes the pattern case-insensitive. The ``m`` flag makes ``^`` and ``$`` match the beginning and end of each line. The ``s`` flag makes the ``.`` metacharacters match any character including line terminators. The pattern will match strings like ``hello\nworld``, ``hello world``, and ``HELLO \n WORld``.

### Using regexp values

The ``RegExp`` values can be used with the [RegExp](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/lang.regexp) methods (``split``, ``findAll``, ``findAllGroups``, etc.) and with the [string](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/lang.string) methods [includesMatch](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/lang.string/latest#includesMatch) and [matches](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/lang.string/latest#matches).

Two constructs are utilized to provide the output of these lang library functions:
- ``Span``: An object type that functions as a container for substrings.
- ``Groups``: A tuple comprising ``Span`` objects where the first member of the tuple always represents the entire match.

```ballerina
import ballerina/io;
import ballerina/lang.regexp;

public function main() {
    string[] names = re `,`.split("Bob,Frank,Will,Jack"); // ["Bob","Frank","Will","Jack"]
    
    int patternCount = re `[bB].tt[a-z]*`.findAll("Butter was bought by Betty but the butter was bitter.").length(); // 4

    string result = re `0+`.replaceAll("10010011", "*"); // 1*1*11

    // Extract the username and domain name from an email
    regexp:Groups? emailGroups = re `([a-z]+)@([a-z]+\.[a-z]{2,})`.findGroups("bob@example.net");
    if emailGroups is regexp:Groups {
        regexp:Span username = <regexp:Span>emailGroups[1];
        // Prints the matched substring with its starting and ending indexes
        io:println(string `substring: ${username.substring()} start: ${username.startIndex} end: ${username.endIndex}`);

        regexp:Span domain = <regexp:Span>emailGroups[2];
        io:println(string `substring: ${domain.substring()} start: ${domain.startIndex} end: ${domain.endIndex}`);
    }
}
```

## ``typedesc`` Type

The ``typedesc`` type is a built-in type representing a type descriptor and is immutable. It has a type parameter that describes the types that are described by the type descriptors that belong to that type descriptor. A ``typedesc`` value belongs to type ``typedesc<T>`` if the type descriptor describes a type that is a subtype of ``T``.

```ballerina
type R record {
    int x;
    int y;
};

typedesc<record {}> t = R;

// Will return true.
function demo() returns boolean {
    R r = {x: 1, y: 2};
    any v = r;
    return typeof v === t;
}
```

In the above code example, the type **``R``** is a record. **``t``** is a ``typedesc`` representing a record type and **``R``** is assigned to it. Inside the function **``demo()``**, a value of type **``R``** is constructed as **``r``**, which is then assigned to **``v``** of the ``any`` type. Finally, the ``typeof`` operator is used to retrieve the ``typedesc`` value of **``v``** which is compared with the typedesc of **``t``**.
The ``typeof`` operator gets the dynamic type of a value. Dynamic types for mutable structures are inherent types.

## ``ensureType`` function

The **``ensureType()``** function is a lang library function that is similar to a cast. It takes a ``typedesc`` value as an argument. With the usual cast operation, you get a panic if the cast is not possible, and this is something that you may not want when dealing with situations such as handling user inputs. With ``ensureType()`` an error is returned.

```ballerina
function demo(anydata v)
            returns float|error {
    return v.ensureType(float);
}
```

In the above code example, **``v``** is cast to the ``float`` type by calling **``ensureType()``**. Therefore the calling function **``demo( )``** can return a ``float`` value or an ``error`` value. **``ensureType()``** also performs numeric conversion just like casting operations.

## Dependent types

Assigning the result of ``ensureType()`` above to ``float`` works without having to use a type case expression (``<T>x``), because Ballerina supports a concept called dependent types that makes the return type of a function dependent on the value of a parameter. Unlike the normal convention where the return type is defined independently, here the return type depends on a parameter which is a type descriptor.

The **``ensureType()``** function also implements this feature.

```ballerina
// Declaration in lang.value
public isolated function ensureType(
    any|error v,
    typedesc<any> t = <>
    ) returns t|error
= external;
```

In this case, the function accepts the type descriptor parameter **``t``**  and the return type is either of type **``t``** or an error. The implementation of this code is currently external since there is limited support within the language for handling this feature within the code.

This function also works through implicit type identification based on the context.

```ballerina
function demo(json j) returns error? {
    float f = check j.ensureType();
}
```

In the above code example, the **``ensureType()``** function is called on **``j``**, and it returns a ``float`` value which is assigned to **``f``**, which is of the ``float`` type. This happens because the function parameter **``t``** of **``ensureType()``** has a default value of ``<>`` which causes the compiler to infer the argument for **``t``** from the function call context.

## Annotation declaration and access

You can declare your own annotations and use them across modules.

```ballerina
// Module m
public type IntConstraints record {
    int minInclusive?;
    int maxInclusive?;
};

public annotation IntConstraints ConstrainedInt on type;
```

In the above code example, the annotation declaration declares an annotation tag **``ConstrainedInt``** with the type **``IntConstraints``** as the type of the value associated with the annotation. The syntactic construct type which follows on declares that this annotation can be applied on types.

This can be used in another module, as follows.

```ballerina
// In another module
@m:ConstrainedInt {minInclusive: 1}
type PositiveInt int;

m:IntConstraints? c = PositiveInt.@m:ConstrainedInt;
```

In the above code example, the **``ConstrainedInt``** annotation is defined with just the **``minInclusive``** field. It is applied to a type **``PositiveInt``**.  At runtime, a ``typedesc`` value can be used to access the annotations. You can use a reference to **``PositiveInt``** to get the ``typedesc`` value and then use the ``.@`` notation on it followed by the annotation tag to retrieve the particular annotation. If the annotation is present, annotation access will return a value of the associated type **``IntConstraints``**. Since the annotation may or may not be specified, annotation access may also return nil. Therefore, the result of annotation access will be the union of **``IntConstraints``** and nil.

## Trapping panics

Ballerina provides an option to trap panics. By trapping panics using the ``trap`` keyword, you can stop a panic and get access to the associated error value.

```ballerina
function safeAdd(int n1, int n2)
                    returns int|error {
    // On overflow, get an error
    // rather than a panic  
    return trap (n1 + n2);
}
```

In the above code example, the expression ``(n1 + n2)`` is evaluated. Under normal circumstances, the expression will return an integer. However, if there is an overflow, there will be a panic, but the trap captures it and provides access to it as an error.
