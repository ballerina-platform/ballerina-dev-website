intro: This guide walks you through compiling a Ballerina application to a native executable and packing the native executable in a container.
---

This feature was introduced as an experimental feature in the Swan Lake Update 3 release and it will become official in the upcoming releases. In case you come across any issues do report them as the Ballerina community will be aggressively addressing them.

The key aspects below help you understand the native executable generating process better.

## GraalVM

Building a Ballerina native executable requires the [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org) [native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/22.3/reference-manual/native-image/) compiler. GraalVM is a high-performance, cloud native, and polyglot JDK designed to accelerate the execution of applications. There are three different distributions on GraalVM: Oracle GraalVM Community Edition (CE), Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition (EE), and Mandrel. You can install any to use the Ballerina native functionality.

- GraalVM CE is the free version of GraalVM, which is distributed under GPLv2+CE.
- GraaLVM EE is the paid version of GraalVM, which comes with a few additional features such as options for GC, debugging, and other optimizations.
- Mandrel is a downstream distribution of the Oracle GraalVM CE, which is maintained by Red Hat.

This article uses GraalVM CE to discuss the following topics.

## Native executable vs. Uber Jar

When compiling a  Ballerina application using the `bal build` command the output is an uber JAR file. As you already know, running the JAR requires a JVM. JVM uses a Just In Time (JIT) compiler to generate native code during runtime.

On the other hand, when compiling a Ballerina application using `bal build --native`, the output is the native executable local to the host machine. In order to build the native executable, GraalVM uses Ahead Of Time compilation (AOT), which requires the generated uber JAR as the input to produce the native executable. Native Image generation performs aggressive optimizations such as unused code elimination in the JDK and its dependencies, heap snapshotting, and static code initializations.

The difference between both approaches result in different pros and cons as depicted in the spider graph below.

<img src="/learn/images/aot-vs-jit.png" alt="AOT vs JIT" height="520" style="width: auto !important; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px">

As depicted in the image, AOT compilation with GraalVM provides the following advantages over the standard JIT compilation making it ideal for container runtimes.
- Use a fraction of the resources required by the JVM.
- Applications start in milliseconds.
- Deliver peak performance immediately with no warmup.
- Can be packaged into lightweight container images for faster and more efficient deployments.
- Reduced attack surface.

The only downside is that the GraalVM native image build is a highly complicated process, which may consume a lot of memory and CPU resulting in an extended build time. However, the GraalVM community is continuously working on improving its performance.

## Ballerina native image

From Ballerina 2201.3.0 (SwanLake) onwards, Ballerina supports GraalVM AOT compilation to generate standalone executables by passing the native flag in the build command: `bal build --native`. The generated executable contains the modules in the current package, their dependencies, Ballerina runtime, and statically linked native code from the JDK.

> **Info:** Apart from the Ballerina runtime and [standard libraries](/learn/ballerina-specifications/#standard-library-specifications), the following Ballerina extended modules are GraalVM-compatible :
>  - [`nats`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/nats)
>  - [`kafka`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/kafka)
>  - [`rabbitmq`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/rabbitmq)
>  - [`jdbc`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/java.jdbc)
>  - [`mssql`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/mssql)
>  - [`mysql`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/mysql)
>  - [`oracledb`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/oracledb)
>  - [`postgresql`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/postgresql)

## Build the native executable locally

### Set up the prerequisites

To complete this part of the guide, you need:
1. [Ballerina 2201.3.0 (Swan Lake)](/learn/install-ballerina/set-up-ballerina/) or greater
2. A text editor
   >**Tip:** Preferably, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> with the  <a href="https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/get-started/install-the-extension/" target="_blank">Ballerina extension</a> installed.
3. GraalVM installed and configured appropriately
4. A command terminal

### Configure GraalVM

1. Install GraalVM if you have not done it already.
    - Install GraalVM on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via Git Bash, Cygwin, or WSL) using the following command.
      ```
      $ bash <(curl -sL https://get.graalvm.org/jdk)  graalvm-ce-java11-22.3.0
      ```
      > **Note:** The above command installs the native-image tool, which is required to generate the native images along with GraalVM. Follow the instructions in the output log to resolve prerequisites for GraalVM native image.
    - For additional information, see [Get Started with GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/22.3/docs/getting-started).
2. Configure the runtime environment. Set the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to the GraalVM installation directory as directed at the end of the execution of the above command.

> **Note:** 
> - On Windows, the native image requires Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). For instructions on installing Visual Studio Code with the Windows 10 SDK, go to [Using GraalVM and Native Image on Windows 10](https://medium.com/graalvm/using-graalvm-and-native-image-on-windows-10-9954dc071311).
> - On the ARM64 architecture of macOS, the Ballerina native image build will work with Ballerina 2201.5.0 (Swan Lake) or greater. For more information, see [this issue comment](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues/39003#issuecomment-1498765016).
> - The GraalVM native-image tool support for Apple M1 (darwin-aarch64) is still experimental. For more updates, see [Support for Apple M1](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2666).

After the environment is set up, follow the steps below to build a native executable for a simple Ballerina HTTP server application.

### Build the native executable

1. Execute the command below to create a Ballerina service package :
   ```
   $ bal new hello_world -t service
   ```

2. Replace the content of the `service.bal` file with the following.
   ```ballerina
   import ballerina/http;

   service / on new http:Listener(8080) {
       resource function get greeting() returns string { 
              return "Hello, World!"; 
       }
   }
   ```

3. Run `bal build --native` to create the native executable.
   ```
   $ bal build --native

   ```

   > **Note:** On Windows, the Microsoft Native Tools for Visual Studio must be initialized before building a native-image. You can do this by starting the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt** that was installed with the Visual Studio Build Tools. In the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt, navigate to your project folder and run `bal build --native`.

4. Execute the command below to run the native executable.
   ```
   $ ./target/bin/hello_world
   ```

5. Test the service with a cURL request :
   ```
   $ curl http://localhost:8080/greeting
   Hello, World!
   ```

Now, you have built and tested a native executable locally for a simple Ballerina HTTP server application. 

## Pack the native executable in a container

### Set up the prerequisites

To complete this part of the guide, you need:
1. [Ballerina 2201.3.0 (Swan Lake)](/learn/install-ballerina/set-up-ballerina/) or greater
2. A text editor
   >**Tip:** Preferably, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> with the  <a href="https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/get-started/install-the-extension/" target="_blank">Ballerina extension</a> installed.
3. [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and configured in your machine
   >**Tip:** Since the GraalVM native build consumes a significant amount of memory, it is recommended to increase the memory allocated to Docker to at least 8GB and potentially add more CPUs as well. For more details, see [How to assign more memory to Docker container](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44533319/how-to-assign-more-memory-to-docker-container/44533437#44533437).
4. A command terminal

After the environment is set up, follow the steps below to build the native executable and pack it in a container.

### Build the native executable in a container

1. Execute the command below to create a Ballerina service package :
   ```
   $ bal new hello_docker -t service
   ```

2. Replace the content of the file `service.bal` with the following.
   ```ballerina
   import ballerina/http;

   service / on new http:Listener(8080) {
       resource function get greeting() returns string {   
              return "Hello, Docker!";   
       }
   }
   ```

3. Execute `bal build --native --cloud=docker` to generate the artifacts with the native executable. Optionally, you can create a file named `Cloud.toml` in the package directory to add cloud related configurations. For more information, see [Docker](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/c2c-docker-deployment/) and [Kubernetes](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/c2c-k8s-deployment/) documentation.

## Execute tests with the native image

It is recommended to use the JVM for verifying the functionality of the application with sufficient tests and code coverage as running tests against the native image could take time. Running tests against the native image is only required when using libraries that are not verified against the GraalVM native image build. All Ballerina standard libraries are verified and guaranteed to produce native image builds without any issues. The complete list of verified libraries can be found at the top of the article. 

Therefore, if the application is depending on a package that is not verified against the GraalVM native build, it is recommended to run the tests against the native image to ensure that there are no runtime errors by executing the `bal test --native` command.

Also, native testing can be scheduled as a daily check within CI(Continuous Integration) pipelines to maintain compatibility with GraalVM.

Follow the steps below to run the tests with the native image.


1. Follow the steps 1 and 2 in [Build the native executable](#build-the-native-executable).

2. Replace the content of the `service_test.bal` file with the following under the `tests` folder.  
   ```ballerina
   import ballerina/http;
   import ballerina/test;

   http:Client testClient = check new ("http://localhost:8080");

   @test:Config {}
   function testServiceWithProperName() {
      string|error response = testClient->get("/greeting");
      test:assertEquals(response, "Hello, World!");
   }

   ```

3.  Run `bal test --native` to run the tests using the native executable. 
      > **Info:**  This command will build a native executable with tests similar to `bal build --native` , and the tests will be executed by running this native executable.
      ```
               Running Tests
               hello_world
                        [pass] testServiceWithProperName
                        1 passing
                        0 failing
                        0 skipped
      ```

Now, you  tested a simple Ballerina HTTP server application for GraalVM compatibility.

> **Note:** Code coverage  and runtime debug features are not supported with the native image testing.
