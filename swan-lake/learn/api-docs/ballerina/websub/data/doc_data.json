{"packages":[{"isSingleFile":false,"name":"websub","orgName":"ballerina","version":"1.1.0","description":"## Module Overview\n\nThis module contains an implementation of the W3C [**WebSub**](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) recommendation, which facilitates a push-based content delivery/notification mechanism between publishers and subscribers.\n\nThis implementation supports introducing WebSub Subscriber, A party interested in receiving update notifications for particular topics.\n\n### Basic flow with WebSub\n1. The subscriber discovers from the publisher, the topic it needs to subscribe to and the hub(s) that deliver notifications on updates of the topic.\n\n2. The subscriber sends a subscription request to one or more discovered hub(s) specifying the discovered topic along \n with other subscription parameters such as:\n    - The callback URL to which content is expected to be delivered.\n    - (Optional) The lease period (in seconds) the subscriber wants the subscription to stay active.\n    - (Optional) A secret to use for [authenticated content distribution](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#signing-content).\n  \n3. The hub sends an intent verification request to the specified callback URL. If the response indicates \nverification\n (by echoing a challenge specified in the request) by the subscriber, the subscription is added for the topic at the \n hub.\n   \n4. The publisher notifies the hub of updates to the topic and the content to deliver is identified.\n\n5. The hub delivers the identified content to the subscribers of the topic.\n\n### Features\n\n#### Subscriber\n\nThis module allows introducing a WebSub Subscriber Service with `onIntentVerification`, which accepts HTTP GET requests for intent verification, and `onNotification`, which accepts HTTP POST requests for notifications. The WebSub Subscriber Service provides the following capabilities:\n - When the service is started a subscription request is sent for a hub/topic combination, either specified as annotations or discovered based on the resource URL specified as an annotation.\n - If `onIntentVerification` is not specified, intent verification will be done automatically against the topic specified as an annotation or discovered based on the resource URL specified as an annotation.\n - If a secret is specified for the subscription, signature validation will be done for authenticated content distribution.\n \n**Sends subscription request on service startup and explicit intent verification**\n  \n  \u003e When the `subscribeOnStartUp` is set to true in the Subscriber Service, it will result in a subscription request being sent to the specified hub for the specified topic, with the specified lease seconds value and the specified secret for authenticated content distribution. \n  \n  \u003e Since an `onIntentVerification` resource function is not included, intent verification for subscription and unsubscription requests would happen automatically.\n\n    ```ballerina\n    @websub:SubscriberServiceConfig {\t\n        path: \"/websub\",\t\n        subscribeOnStartUp: true,\t\n        target: [\"\u003cHUB_URL\u003e\", \"\u003cTOPIC_URL\u003e\"],\t\n        leaseSeconds: 3600,\t\n        secret: \"\u003cSECRET\u003e\"\t\n    }\t\n    service websubSubscriber on websubEP {\t\n        resource function onNotification(websub:Notification notification) {\t\n            //...\n        }\t\n    }\n    ```\n    \n  \u003e Explicit intent verification can be done by introducing an `onIntentVerification` resource function.\n \n    ```ballerina\n        resource function onIntentVerification(websub:Caller caller, websub:IntentVerificationRequest request) {\t\n            http:Response response \u003d new;\t\n            // Insert logic to build subscription/unsubscription intent verification response.\t\n            error? result \u003d caller-\u003erespond(response);\n        }\n     ```\n \nFunctions are made available on the `websub:IntentVerificationRequest` to build a subscription or unsubscription \nverification response, specifying the topic to verify intent against:\n```ballerina\nhttp:Response response \u003d request.buildSubscriptionVerificationResponse(\"\u003cTOPIC_TO_VERIFY_FOR\u003e\");\n```\n```ballerina\nhttp:Response response \u003d request.buildUnsubscriptionVerificationResponse(\"\u003cTOPIC_TO_VERIFY_FOR\u003e\");\n```\n\n### Introducing Specific Subscriber Services (Webhook Callback Services)\n\nBallerina\u0027s WebSub subscriber service listener can be extended to introduce specific Webhooks.\n \nInstead of the single `onNotification` resource, you can introduce multiple resources to accept content delivery requests using specific subscriber services. These resources will correspond to the content delivery requests that will \n be delivered with respect to a particular topic.\n \nFor example, assume a scenario in which you receive notifications either when an issue is opened or when an issue is closed by subscribing to a particular topic in an issue tracking system. With a custom subscriber service listener, which extends the \ngeneric WebSub subscriber service listener, you can allow two resources to accept content delivery requests (e.g., `onIssueOpened` and `onIssueClosed`) instead of the `onNotification` resource.\n\nThese resources will accept two parameters:\n1. The generic `websub:Notification` record as the first parameter\n2. A custom record corresponding to the expected (JSON) payload of the notification (e.g., `IssueCreatedEvent`,\n`IssueClosedEvent`)\n\nYou can introduce a specific service as such by extending the generic subscriber service listener, specifying a \nmapping between the expected notifications and the resources that requests need to be dispatched to.\n\nThe mapping can be based on one of the following indicators of a notification request. \n(Requests will then be dispatched based on the value of the indicator in the request and a pre-defined mapping.)\n\n- A request header \n\n    Dispatching will be based on the value of the request header specified as `topicHeader`. \n    \n    ```ballerina\n    websub:ExtensionConfig extensionConfig \u003d {\n        topicIdentifier: websub:TOPIC_ID_HEADER,\n        topicHeader: \"\u003cHEADER_TO_CONSIDER\u003e\",\n        headerResourceMap: {\n            \"issueOpened\": [\"onIssueOpened\", IssueOpenedEvent],\n            \"issueClosed\": [\"onIssueClosed\", IssueClosedEvent]\n        }\n    };\n    ```\n    \n    The `\"issueOpened\": [\"onIssueOpened\", IssueOpenedEvent]` entry indicates that when the value of the\n    `\u003cHEADER_TO_CONSIDER\u003e` header is `issueOpened`, dispatching should happen to a resource named `onIssueOpened`. \n    \n    The first parameter of this resource will be the generic `websub:Notification` record, and the second parameter will \n    be a custom `IssueOpenedEvent` record mapping the JSON payload received when an issue is created.\n\n- The payload: the value of a particular key in the JSON payload\n\n    Dispatching will be based on the value in the request payload of one of the map keys specified in the \n    `payloadKeyResourceMap` map.\n    \n    ```ballerina\n    websub:ExtensionConfig extensionConfig \u003d {\n        topicIdentifier: websub:TOPIC_ID_PAYLOAD_KEY,\n        payloadKeyResourceMap: {\n            \"\u003cPAYLOAD_KEY_TO_CONSIDER\u003e\": {\n                \"issueOpened\": [\"onIssueOpened\", IssueOpenedEvent],\n                \"issueClosed\": [\"onIssueClosed\", IssueClosedEvent]\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    ```\n    \n    The `\"issueOpened\": [\"onIssueOpened\", IssueOpenedEvent]` entry indicates that when the value for the JSON payload\n     key `\u003cPAYLOAD_KEY_TO_CONSIDER\u003e` is `issueOpened`, dispatching should happen to a resource named `onIssueOpened`.\n    \n    The first parameter of this resource will be the generic `websub:Notification` record, and the second parameter will \n    be a custom `IssueOpenedEvent` record, mapping the JSON payload received when an issue is created.  \n\n- A request header and the payload (combination of the above two)\n\n    Dispatching will be based on both a request header and the payload as specified in the `headerAndPayloadKeyResourceMap`. \n    Also, you can introduce a `headerResourceMap` and/or a `payloadKeyResourceMap` as additional mappings.\n     \n    ```ballerina\n    websub:ExtensionConfig extensionConfig \u003d {\n        topicIdentifier: websub:TOPIC_ID_HEADER_AND_PAYLOAD,\n        topicHeader: \"\u003cHEADER_TO_CONSIDER\u003e\",\n        headerAndPayloadKeyResourceMap: {\n            \"issue\" : {\n                \"\u003cPAYLOAD_KEY_TO_CONSIDER\u003e\" : {\n                    \"opened\": [\"onIssueOpened\", IssueOpenedEvent],\n                    \"closed\": [\"onIssueClosed\", IssueClosedEvent]\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    ```\n    The `\"opened\": [\"onIssueOpened\", IssueOpenedEvent]` entry indicates that when the value of the\n    `\u003cHEADER_TO_CONSIDER\u003e` header is `issue` and the value of the `\u003cPAYLOAD_KEY_TO_CONSIDER\u003e` JSON payload key is `opened`, \n    dispatching should happen to a resource named `onIssueOpened`.\n\n    The first parameter of this resource will be the generic `websub:Notification` record and the second parameter will \n    be a custom `IssueOpenedEvent` record, mapping the JSON payload received when an issue is created. \n     \n#### The Specific Subscriber Service\n\nIn order to introduce a specific subscriber service, a new Ballerina `listener` needs to be introduced. This `listener` should wrap the generic `ballerina/websub:Listener` and include the extension configuration described above.\n\nThe following example is for a service provider that\n- allows registering webhooks to receive notifications when an issue is opened or assigned\n- includes a header named \"Event-Header\" in each content delivery request indicating what event the notification is \nfor (e.g., \"onIssueOpened\" when an issue is opened and \"onIssueAssigned\" when an issue is assigned)\n\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/lang.\u0027object as objects;\nimport ballerina/websub;\n\n// Introduce a record mapping the JSON payload received when an issue is opened.\npublic type IssueOpenedEvent record {\n    int id;\n    string title;\n    string openedBy;\n}; \n\n// Introduce a record mapping the JSON payload received when an issue is assigned.\npublic type IssueAssignedEvent record {\n    int id;\n    string assignedTo;\n}; \n\n// Introduce a new `listener` wrapping the generic `ballerina/websub:Listener` \npublic class WebhookListener {\n\n    *objects:Listener;\n\n    private websub:Listener websubListener;\n\n    public function init(int port) {\n        // Introduce the extension config, based on the mapping details.\n        websub:ExtensionConfig extensionConfig \u003d {\n            topicIdentifier: websub:TOPIC_ID_HEADER,\n            topicHeader: \"Event-Header\",\n            headerResourceMap: {\n                \"issueOpened\": [\"onIssueOpened\", IssueOpenedEvent],\n                \"issueAssigned\": [\"onIssueAssigned\", IssueAssignedEvent]\n            }\n        };\n        \n        // Set the extension config in the generic `websub:Listener` config.\n        websub:SubscriberListenerConfiguration sseConfig \u003d {\n            extensionConfig: extensionConfig\n        };\n            \n        // Initialize the wrapped generic listener.\n        self.websubListener \u003d new(port, sseConfig);\n    }\n\n    public function __attach(service s, string? name \u003d ()) returns error?  {\n        return self.websubListener.__attach(s, name);\n    }\n\n    public function __start() returns error? {\n        return self.websubListener.__start();\n    }\n    \n    public function __detach(service s) returns error? {\n        return self.websubListener.__detach(s);\n    }\n    \n    public function __immediateStop() returns error? {\n        return self.websubListener.__immediateStop();\n    }\n\n    public function __gracefulStop() returns error? {\n        return self.websubListener.__gracefulStop();\n    }\n};    \n```\n\nA service can be introduced for the above service provider as follows.\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/io;\nimport ballerina/log;\nimport ballerina/websub;\n\n@websub:SubscriberServiceConfig {\n    path: \"/subscriber\",\n    subscribeOnStartUp: false\n}\nservice specificSubscriber on new WebhookListener(8080) {\n    resource function onIssueOpened(websub:Notification notification, IssueOpenedEvent issueOpened) {\n        log:print(io:sprintf(\"Issue opened: ID: %s, Title: %s\", issueOpened.id, issueOpened.title));\n    }\n    \n    resource function onIssueAssigned(websub:Notification notification, IssueAssignedEvent issueAssigned) {\n        log:print(io:sprintf(\"Issue ID %s assigned to %s\", issueAssigned.id, issueAssigned.assignedTo));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on introducing custom subscriber services, see the [\"Create Webhook Callback Services\"](https://ballerina.io/learn/how-to-extend-ballerina/#create-webhook-callback-services) section of \"How to Extend Ballerina\". \n \nFor information on the operations, which you can perform with this module, see the below **Functions**.

This `listener` should wrap the generic `ballerina/websub:Listener` and include the extension configuration described above.\n\nThe following example is for a service provider that\n- allows registering webhooks to receive notifications when an issue is opened or assigned\n- includes a header named \"Event-Header\" in each content delivery request indicating what event the notification is \nfor (e.g., \"onIssueOpened\" when an issue is opened and \"onIssueAssigned\" when an issue is assigned)\n\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/lang.\u0027object as objects;\nimport ballerina/websub;\n\n// Introduce a record mapping the JSON payload received when an issue is opened.\npublic type IssueOpenedEvent record {\n    int id;\n    string title;\n    string openedBy;\n}; \n\n// Introduce a record mapping the JSON payload received when an issue is assigned.\npublic type IssueAssignedEvent record {\n    int id;\n    string assignedTo;\n}; \n\n// Introduce a new `listener` wrapping the generic `ballerina/websub:Listener` \npublic class WebhookListener {\n\n    *objects:Listener;\n\n    private websub:Listener websubListener;\n\n    public function init(int port) {\n        // Introduce the extension config, based on the mapping details.\n        websub:ExtensionConfig extensionConfig \u003d {\n            topicIdentifier: websub:TOPIC_ID_HEADER,\n            topicHeader: \"Event-Header\",\n            headerResourceMap: {\n                \"issueOpened\": [\"onIssueOpened\", IssueOpenedEvent],\n                \"issueAssigned\": [\"onIssueAssigned\", IssueAssignedEvent]\n            }\n        };\n        \n        // Set the extension config in the generic `websub:Listener` config.\n        websub:SubscriberListenerConfiguration sseConfig \u003d {\n            extensionConfig: extensionConfig\n        };\n            \n        // Initialize the wrapped generic listener.\n        self.websubListener \u003d new(port, sseConfig);\n    }\n\n    public function __attach(service s, string? name \u003d ()) returns error?  {\n        return self.websubListener.__attach(s, name);\n    }\n\n    public function __start() returns error? {\n        return self.websubListener.__start();\n    }\n    \n    public function __detach(service s) returns error? {\n        return self.websubListener.__detach(s);\n    }\n    \n    public function __immediateStop() returns error? {\n        return self.websubListener.__immediateStop();\n    }\n\n    public function __gracefulStop() returns error? {\n        return self.websubListener.__gracefulStop();\n    }\n};    \n```\n\nA service can be introduced for the above service provider as follows.\n```ballerina\nimport ballerina/io;\nimport ballerina/log;\nimport ballerina/websub;\n\n@websub:SubscriberServiceConfig {\n    path: \"/subscriber\",\n    subscribeOnStartUp: false\n}\nservice specificSubscriber on new WebhookListener(8080) {\n    resource function onIssueOpened(websub:Notification notification, IssueOpenedEvent issueOpened) {\n        log:print(io:sprintf(\"Issue opened: ID: %s, Title: %s\", issueOpened.id, issueOpened.title));\n    }\n    \n    resource function onIssueAssigned(websub:Notification notification, IssueAssignedEvent issueAssigned) {\n        log:print(io:sprintf(\"Issue ID %s assigned to %s\", issueAssigned.id, issueAssigned.assignedTo));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on introducing custom subscriber services, see the [\"Create Webhook Callback Services\"](https://ballerina.io/learn/how-to-extend-ballerina/#create-webhook-callback-services) section of \"How to Extend Ballerina\". \n \nFor information on the operations, which you can perform with this module, see the below **Functions**.
