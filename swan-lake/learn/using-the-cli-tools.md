## Using the 'ballerina' Tool

**Ballerina** is a command-line tool for managing Ballerina source code. It helps you to manage Ballerina projects and modules, test, build, and run programs, etc.

It also enables you to easily install, update, and switch among Ballerina distributions. 

In the CLI, execute the `ballerina help` command to view all the actions you can perform with the `ballerina` Tool as shown below:

![CLI commands](/swan-lake/learn/images/cli-commands.png)

You can use it in the below format.

> `ballerina <THE-COMMAND> <ITS-ARGUEMENTS>`

> **Tip:** You can view details of any of the commands below by executing `ballerina help <COMMAND>`. For example, the below is the output of the `ballerina help pull` command.
