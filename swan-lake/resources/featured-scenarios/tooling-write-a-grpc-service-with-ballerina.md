## Set up the prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

1. [Ballerina 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)](/downloads/) or greater
2. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> with the <a href="https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/" target="_blank">Ballerina extension</a> installed.

## Understand the implementation

In an RPC program, you first define the service interface using an Interface Definition Language (IDL) to create the service definition (i.e., `helloworld.proto`). gRPC commonly uses Protocol Buffers as the IDL.

As illustrated in the diagram below, next, you compile the service definition file (i.e., `helloworld.proto`), and generate the source code for both the service and client applications. In Ballerina, you can generate the source code using the built-in `Protocol Buffers to Ballerina` tool.

## Create the service definition

To create a simple service definition in Protocol Buffers, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory named `grpc_sample` in a preferred location (this is your main directory).

2. Open the `grpc_sample` directory in your text editor. 

    >**Tip:** If you have VS Code installed, in the terminal, navigate to the `grpc_sample` directory, and execute the `code .` command.

3. Inside the `grpc_sample` directory, create a new service definition file (i.e., `helloworld.proto`).

4. Copy the service definition below to the `helloworld.proto` file.
  > **Info:** This sample service definition is taken from the [Quick start](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/) guide on the gRPC official site.


  ```proto
  syntax = "proto3";

  package helloworld;

  // The greeting service definition.
  service Greeter {
    // Sends a greeting.
    rpc sayHello(HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
  }

  // The request message with the user's name.
  message HelloRequest {
    string name = 1;
  }

  // The response message with the greetings.
  message HelloReply {
    string message = 1;
  }
  ```

Now, letâ€™s implement the gRPC service and client in the Ballerina language.

## Implement the gRPC service

Ballerina uses packages to group code. You need to create a Ballerina package, generate the service code in the package, and write the business logic.
