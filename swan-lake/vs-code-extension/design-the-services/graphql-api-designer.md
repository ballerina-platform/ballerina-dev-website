## Open the GraphQL API Designer 

Use the source code below to create a GraphQL service using the code editor and click on the **Visualize** codeLens, which is placed above the service. 

```ballerina
import ballerina/graphql;

public type Profile record {|
    string name;
    int age;
    Address address;
|};

public type Address record {|
    string number;
    string street;
    string city;
|};

service /graphql on new graphql:Listener(9090) {

    // A resource method with the `get` accessor inside a `graphql:Service` represents a field in the
    // root `Query` type.
    resource function get greeting() returns string {
        return "Hello, World";
    }

}
```

## Explore the GraphQL API Designer 

The GraphQL API Designer provides the following features.

- Add GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscription operations
- Create and edit constructs such as records and service classes
- Navigate to the specific source code

## Use the GraphQL API Designer functionalities

You can perform the above functionalities using the GraphQL API Designer as follows.

### Add a GraphQL query

Add a query to the GraphQL service with a `Profile` record as the output object.

>**Info:** Hover over each field to view the provided **Edit**, **Delete**, and **Design** GraphQL operations.
