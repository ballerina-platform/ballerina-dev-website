# Implement the code

When you use the Ballerina VS Code extension, you can view your code in graphical mode via the Sequence Diagram View and develop your program logic by using it. It allows you to look at your program logic holistically and comprehend the program at a glance. 

Also, the Data Mapper allows you to visually translate data from one format to another (such as from one JSON format to another). It comes with an intuitive user interface and prevents the need to know the programming logic underneath.

For more detailed information on these tools, see the topics below.
