## Install the Ballerina extension

Follow the steps below to set up the required prerequisites and install the Ballerina extension.

1. Install the [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) version `1.60.0` or later.

2. Download and install [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/downloads/).
 
3. Install the [Ballerina VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.ballerina). 

4. Open a [single Ballerina package](#open-a-single-ballerina-package) or [multiple Ballerina packages](#open-multiple-ballerina-packages) to activate the extension.

## Open Ballerina packages

You can either work on a single [Ballerina package](https://ballerina.io/learn/package-references/) at a time or use [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) of VS Code to work on several related Ballerina packages at the same time. 

>**Info:** When the extension is activated properly, you can see the `Ballerina SDK: <version>` in the status bar at the bottom left corner.

### Open a single Ballerina package

Use one of the following options to open a Ballerina package:

1. From the command line, navigate to the directory path of the package, and execute the `code .` command.

2. From the top menu of the VS Code editor, click **File > Open Folder...**, and select the package.

### Open multiple Ballerina packages

To open multiple Ballerina packages as a VS Code workspace, add all the related Ballerina packages to the workspace using one of the following methods. 

>**Info:** If you already have one Ballerina package opened in the VS Code editor, you can add other related packages to the same workspace. For instructions, see [adding folders to multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_adding-folders).

1. Add each Ballerina package to the workspace using the **Add folder to workspace** option in the top menu of the VS Code editor.

2. Click the **VS Code workspace file** option in the top menu of the VS Code editor to import the packages of an already created workspace to a new workspace.
