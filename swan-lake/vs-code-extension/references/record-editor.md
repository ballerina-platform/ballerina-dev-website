Ballerina is a multi-paradigm language. You can define records in an imperative manner with Ballerina. On top of that, the Ballerina VS Code plugin comes with record editing capabilities, which will help you to edit records graphically.

In the record editor, you have the ability to create a record from scratch or create a record by importing a JSON.
