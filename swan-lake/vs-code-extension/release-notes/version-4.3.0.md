## New features

Below are the new features introduced by this release.

### Entity Relationship Diagram

With the latest Ballerina VS Code extension release (version 4.3.0) and <a href="https://ballerina.io/downloads/" target="_blank">Ballerina Swan lake Update 6 release</a>, now, you can generate the entity relationship diagram for your Ballerina persist model. This feature can be accessed using the icon available on the top-right corner of the editor panel or using the `Ballerina: Entity Relationship Diagram` command available in the VS Code command palette.

### TOML config generator

You can now automatically generate the `Config.toml` file for your Ballerina project. If there are mandatory configurable variables when you run the program via VS Code, it will prompt asking if you would like to create the `Config.toml` file. If you select **Create Config.toml**, it will create the `Config.toml` file in the package root. If a `Config.toml` file is already available, it will update it with new configurable fields. 

>**Tip:** The `Config.toml` file will be added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent keys from getting committed to the GitHub repository.
