intro: The Ballerina VS Code extension provides the ability to run the tests you have written in your Ballerina programs.

Tests are written in Ballerina programs by annotating them with `@test:Config`. 

Click the **Run** CodeLens, which appears when you hover over the `@test:Config` annotation to execute the tests. Also, click the **Debug** CodeLens to add breakpoints and debug the tests.
