intro: GraphQL is an open-source data querying and manipulation language for APIs. While you develop a GraphQL service, you need to try it and debug it to check how it works.

The Ballerina VS Code extension provides the GraphQL **Try it** view, which gives the ability to try GraphQL services within VS Code instead of using any third-party software.

## Write the GraphQL service

Add the code below to the `main.bal` file of your Ballerina project.

```ballerina
import ballerina/graphql;

# A service representing a network-accessible GraphQL API.
service / on new graphql:Listener(8090) {

    # A resource for generating greetings.
    # + name - the input string name
    # + return - string name with greeting message or error
    resource function get greeting(string name) returns string|error {
        // Send a response back to the caller.
        if name is "" {
            return error("name should not be empty!");
        }
        return "Hello, " + name;
    }
}
    
```

## Try the GraphQL service

Once you add the above function, the VS Code extension will display a CodeLens called **Try it** on top of the service.

1. Click the **Run** CodeLens to run the program. 
    
    >**Info:**   This opens the terminal and starts running the service.

2. Click the **Try it** CodeLens to open the GraphQL Try it view.

    >**Note:**   The service must be in the running state to use GraphQL Try it view.

3. Once the GraphQL view is opened, click **Explorer** to open the **Explorer** view.

    >**Tip:** You can find all the available APIs from the side menu that opens.

4. Select the APIs that you want to try from the **Explorer** menu.

    >**Info:**   This will automatically generate the payload in the editor. You can edit the payload and add the required parameters (e.g., type your name under the name parameter). Click **Prettify** to format the code.

5. Click **Run** to send the request.

    >**Info:** The response gets displayed in the right-side window.
