These Terms are a legal agreement between you and WSO2. Your registration for, or use of the Sites and any software, repositories, other services, or projects hosted on the Sites (“Services”) shall be deemed to be your acceptance of these Terms. These Terms do not govern your access and use of the Ballerina programming language or related commercial support and services offerings, which may be made available to you under separate license terms.

If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to, and do hereby bind such entity to these Terms.

In connection with User Content, you affirm, represent, and warrant that you either own your User Content or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to grant the rights and licenses granted in these Terms.

2. You retain all ownership rights in User Content owned by you. WSO2 simply displays or makes the User Content available and does not control the User Content posted via the Services and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such User Content. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is inaccurate, misleading, offensive, indecent, infringing, or otherwise objectionable.

However, we will neither monitor nor bear responsibility for ensuring that the license terms attached to your User Content are complied with. We undertake no liability for any violation of the license terms under which you make your User Content available. If you do not specify or upload such license terms with respect to any User Content, you hereby grant us and all other users of the Sites and Services, a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, royalty-free license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and publicly display your User Content (in whole or in part) on the Sites and Services and to incorporate such User Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed;
	- we may delete or archive any User Content where such content has not been used for a certain period of time as determined by us, in our discretion. We may also delete or limit access to any User Content that we determine is violating these terms or any other applicable laws, rules, or regulations; and
