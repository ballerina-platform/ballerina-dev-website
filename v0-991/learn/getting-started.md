## Downloading the Ballerina distribution

You can download the Ballerina distribution from [download page](https://ballerina.io/downloads/) for your operating system.

If a binary distribution is not available for your combination of operating system and architecture, try [installing from source](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang#install-from-source).

### System requirements

Ballerina binary distributions are available for the following supported operating systems and architectures. Ensure that your system meets the requirements before you proceed with the installation.

- Windows Vista SP2 x64 or later
- Ubuntu Linux 12.04 x64 - LTS and above
- Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2 and above
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 x64 and above
- OS X 10.8.3 x64 and above

If your operating system or architecture is not on the list, you can [install from source](#installing-from-source) instead.

## Installing Ballerina via installers

If you are upgrading to the latest version of Ballerina from an older version, you can download the latest version and run it without uninstalling the old version. 
If you are building from source, you must update the path with the new version of Ballerina.

### Installing on OS X

[Download the package file](/downloads) and double-click on it to launch the installer. The installer guides you through the installation process and installs the Ballerina distribution to `/Library/Ballerina`.

The package automatically sets your PATH environment variable for you. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

### Installing on Windows

[Download the MSI file](/downloads) and double-click on it to launch the installer. The installer guides you through the installation process and installs the Ballerina distribution to `C:\Program Files\Ballerina\`.

The installer should put the `C:\Program Files\Ballerina\<ballerina-directory>\bin` directory in your PATH environment variable. You may have to restart any open command prompts for the change to take effect.

### Installing on Linux

* [Download](/downloads) the latest version of Ballerina.

* If you downloaded the DEB file, use the following command to install Ballerina. Replace `<ballerina-home>/<ballerina-binary>.deb` with the actual file path. This installs Ballerina to the `/usr/lib/ballerina` directory.

```
dpkg -i <ballerina-binary>.deb
```

* If you downloaded the RPM file, use the following command to install Ballerina. Replace `<ballerina-home>/<ballerina-binary>.deb` with the actual file path. This installs Ballerina to the `/usr/lib64/ballerina` directory.
 
```
rpm -i <ballerina-binary>.rpm
```

## Installing via the Ballerina language ZIP file

> **Note**: Before you install Ballerina using the ZIP file, ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8 installed.

[Download the Ballerina language ZIP file](/downloads) and unzip it to a preferred location using an archiver tool of your choice. This creates a directory named `ballerina-<version>` in your system.

Follow one of the steps below depending on your operating system to configure your system environment to run Ballerina:

- If your operating system is Linux or Mac OS, set the PATH environment variable to point to the bin directory of the unzipped Ballerina distribution.
- If your operating system is Windows, add a new environment variable specifying the following values:
  - Variable name: PATH
  - Variable value: The location of the bin directory of the unzipped Ballerina distribution. For example,  `C:\Program Files\Ballerina\ballerina-<version>\bin`

## Installing from source

Alternatively, follow the instructions below to install Ballerina from the source.

### Setting up the prerequisites

You need to download and install the below to build the Ballerina modules.
1. Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 8 (from one of the following locations) 
- [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)
>**Note:** Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the path name of the directory into which you installed JDK.
2. [Node.js (version 8.9.x or the latest LTS release)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. [npm (version 5.6.0 or later)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Obtaining the source code
Follow the steps below to obtain the Ballerina source code.

1. Execute the below command to clone the ['ballerina-lang'](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang) source repository.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang.git
```
>**Tip:** If you have already forked the repository to your GitHub account, then execute the below command replacing <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME> with your Git username.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ballerina-lang.git
```

2. Execute the below command to update the Git submodules.

```
git submodule update --init
```

### Building the source

Follow the steps below to build the project of the obtained source.

1. Navigate to the root directory of the Ballerina repo (i.e., <BALLERINA_PROJECT_ROOT>) and execute one of the below Gradle commands to build the project using Gradle.

  - **On Unix/Mac OS:** ```./gradlew build ```
  - **Windows:** ```gradlew build ```

2. Extract the built Ballerina distributions created in the below locations: 

- **runtime only:** <BALLERINA_PROJECT_ROOT>/distribution/zip/jballerina/build/distributions/jballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip
- **runtime and tools (e.g., Ballerina Language Server):** <BALLERINA_PROJECT_ROOT>/distribution/zip/jballerina-tools/build/distributions/jballerina-tools-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip

>**Note:** If you face an IOException error stating “Too many open files”, this is due to the default number of possible open files being set to a lower number on your operating system than required for Ballerina to be compiled. You may have to increase the number of open files/file descriptors (FD) on your operating system to 1000000 (or higher).
  
## Uninstalling Ballerina

To remove an existing Ballerina installation, go to the Ballerina installation location and delete the Ballerina directory.

> **Note**:
> - If you installed Ballerina via an installer, the installation location is usually `/Library/Ballerina` in Mac OS X, `/usr/lib/ballerina/` in Ubuntu and `C:\Program Files\Ballerina\` in Windows.
> - If you have installed via RPM installer, you can use `rpm -e ballerina-<version>-1.x86_64` command.
> - If you installed Ballerina using the Ballerina language ZIP file, be sure to remove the Ballerina PATH environment variable that you set in your system environment.
